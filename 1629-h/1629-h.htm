    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE SMUGGLED SUPPER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Outside the bedroom the night was black and still. The small rain fell too
      softly to be heard in the garden; not a leaf stirred in the airless calm;
      the watch-dog was asleep, the cats were indoors; far or near, under the
      murky heaven, not a sound was stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the bedroom the night was black and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd knew her business as a schoolmistress too well to allow
      night-lights; and Miss Ladd's young ladies were supposed to be fast
      asleep, in accordance with the rules of the house. Only at intervals the
      silence was faintly disturbed, when the restless turning of one of the
      girls in her bed betrayed itself by a gentle rustling between the sheets.
      In the long intervals of stillness, not even the softly audible breathing
      of young creatures asleep was to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sound that told of life and movement revealed the mechanical
      movement of the clock. Speaking from the lower regions, the tongue of
      Father Time told the hour before midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft voice rose wearily near the door of the room. It counted the
      strokes of the clock&mdash;and reminded one of the girls of the lapse of
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily! eleven o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. After an interval the weary voice tried again, in
      louder tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl, whose bed was at the inner end of the room, sighed under the heavy
      heat of the night&mdash;and said, in peremptory tones, "Is that Cecilia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm getting hungry, Emily. Is the new girl asleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The new girl answered promptly and spitefully, "No, she isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a private object of their own in view, the five wise virgins of
      Miss Ladd's first class had waited an hour, in wakeful anticipation of the
      falling asleep of the stranger&mdash;and it had ended in this way! A
      ripple of laughter ran round the room. The new girl, mortified and
      offended, entered her protest in plain words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are treating me shamefully! You all distrust me, because I am a
      stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say we don't understand you," Emily answered, speaking for her
      schoolfellows; "and you will be nearer the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who expected you to understand me, when I only came here to-day? I have
      told you already my name is Francine de Sor. If want to know more, I'm
      nineteen years old, and I come from the West Indies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily still took the lead. "Why do you come <i>here?</i>" she asked. "Who
      ever heard of a girl joining a new school just before the holidays? You
      are nineteen years old, are you? I'm a year younger than you&mdash;and I
      have finished my education. The next big girl in the room is a year
      younger than me&mdash;and she has finished her education. What can you
      possibly have left to learn at your age?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything!" cried the stranger from the West Indies, with an outburst of
      tears. "I'm a poor ignorant creature. Your education ought to have taught
      you to pity me instead of making fun of me. I hate you all. For shame, for
      shame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the girls laughed. One of them&mdash;the hungry girl who had
      counted the strokes of the clock&mdash;took Francine's part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind their laughing, Miss de Sor. You are quite right, you have
      good reason to complain of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss de Sor dried her eyes. "Thank you&mdash;whoever you are," she
      answered briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Cecilia Wyvil," the other proceeded. "It was not, perhaps,
      quite nice of you to say you hated us all. At the same time we have
      forgotten our good breeding&mdash;and the least we can do is to beg your
      pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      This expression of generous sentiment appeared to have an irritating
      effect on the peremptory young person who took the lead in the room.
      Perhaps she disapproved of free trade in generous sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you one thing, Cecilia," she said; "you shan't beat ME in
      generosity. Strike a light, one of you, and lay the blame on me if Miss
      Ladd finds us out. I mean to shake hands with the new girl&mdash;and how
      can I do it in the dark? Miss de Sor, my name's Brown, and I'm queen of
      the bedroom. I&mdash;not Cecilia&mdash;offer our apologies if we have
      offended you. Cecilia is my dearest friend, but I don't allow her to take
      the lead in the room. Oh, what a lovely nightgown!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden flow of candle-light had revealed Francine, sitting up in her
      bed, and displaying such treasures of real lace over her bosom that the
      queen lost all sense of royal dignity in irrepressible admiration. "Seven
      and sixpence," Emily remarked, looking at her own night-gown and despising
      it. One after another, the girls yielded to the attraction of the
      wonderful lace. Slim and plump, fair and dark, they circled round the new
      pupil in their flowing white robes, and arrived by common consent at one
      and the same conclusion: "How rich her father must be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Favored by fortune in the matter of money, was this enviable person
      possessed of beauty as well?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the disposition of the beds, Miss de Sor was placed between Cecilia on
      the right hand, and Emily on the left. If, by some fantastic turn of
      events, a man&mdash;say in the interests of propriety, a married doctor,
      with Miss Ladd to look after him&mdash;had been permitted to enter the
      room, and had been asked what he thought of the girls when he came out, he
      would not even have mentioned Francine. Blind to the beauties of the
      expensive night-gown, he would have noticed her long upper lip, her
      obstinate chin, her sallow complexion, her eyes placed too close together&mdash;and
      would have turned his attention to her nearest neighbors. On one side his
      languid interest would have been instantly roused by Cecilia's glowing
      auburn hair, her exquisitely pure skin, and her tender blue eyes. On the
      other, he would have discovered a bright little creature, who would have
      fascinated and perplexed him at one and the same time. If he had been
      questioned about her by a stranger, he would have been at a loss to say
      positively whether she was dark or light: he would have remembered how her
      eyes had held him, but he would not have known of what color they were.
      And yet, she would have remained a vivid picture in his memory when other
      impressions, derived at the same time, had vanished. "There was one little
      witch among them, who was worth all the rest put together; and I can't
      tell you why. They called her Emily. If I wasn't a married man&mdash;"
      There he would have thought of his wife, and would have sighed and said no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the girls were still admiring Francine, the clock struck the
      half-hour past eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia stole on tiptoe to the door&mdash;looked out, and listened&mdash;closed
      the door again&mdash;and addressed the meeting with the irresistible charm
      of her sweet voice and her persuasive smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are none of you hungry yet?" she inquired. "The teachers are safe in
      their rooms; we have set ourselves right with Francine. Why keep the
      supper waiting under Emily's bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Such reasoning as this, with such personal attractions to recommend it,
      admitted of but one reply. The queen waved her hand graciously, and said,
      "Pull it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a lovely girl&mdash;whose face possesses the crowning charm of
      expression, whose slightest movement reveals the supple symmetry of her
      figure&mdash;less lovely because she is blessed with a good appetite, and
      is not ashamed to acknowledge it? With a grace all her own, Cecilia dived
      under the bed, and produced a basket of jam tarts, a basket of fruit and
      sweetmeats, a basket of sparkling lemonade, and a superb cake&mdash;all
      paid for by general subscriptions, and smuggled into the room by kind
      connivance of the servants. On this occasion, the feast was especially
      plentiful and expensive, in commemoration not only of the arrival of the
      Midsummer holidays, but of the coming freedom of Miss Ladd's two leading
      young ladies. With widely different destinies before them, Emily and
      Cecilia had completed their school life, and were now to go out into the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast in the characters of the two girls showed itself, even in
      such a trifle as the preparations for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentle Cecilia, sitting on the floor surrounded by good things, left it to
      the ingenuity of others to decide whether the baskets should be all
      emptied at once, or handed round from bed to bed, one at a time. In the
      meanwhile, her lovely blue eyes rested tenderly on the tarts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's commanding spirit seized on the reins of government, and employed
      each of her schoolfellows in the occupation which she was fittest to
      undertake. "Miss de Sor, let me look at your hand. Ah! I thought so. You
      have got the thickest wrist among us; you shall draw the corks. If you let
      the lemonade pop, not a drop of it goes down your throat. Effie, Annis,
      Priscilla, you are three notoriously lazy girls; it's doing you a true
      kindness to set you to work. Effie, clear the toilet-table for supper;
      away with the combs, the brushes, and the looking-glass. Annis, tear the
      leaves out of your book of exercises, and set them out for plates. No!
      I'll unpack; nobody touches the baskets but me. Priscilla, you have the
      prettiest ears in the room. You shall act as sentinel, my dear, and listen
      at the door. Cecilia, when you have done devouring those tarts with your
      eyes, take that pair of scissors (Miss de Sor, allow me to apologize for
      the mean manner in which this school is carried on; the knives and forks
      are counted and locked up every night)&mdash;I say take that pair of
      scissors, Cecilia, and carve the cake, and don't keep the largest bit for
      yourself. Are we all ready? Very well. Now take example by me. Talk as
      much as you like, so long as you don't talk too loud. There is one other
      thing before we begin. The men always propose toasts on these occasions;
      let's be like the men. Can any of you make a speech? Ah, it falls on me as
      usual. I propose the first toast. Down with all schools and teachers&mdash;especially
      the new teacher, who came this half year. Oh, mercy, how it stings!" The
      fixed gas in the lemonade took the orator, at that moment, by the throat,
      and effectually checked the flow of her eloquence. It made no difference
      to the girls. Excepting the ease of feeble stomachs, who cares for
      eloquence in the presence of a supper-table? There were no feeble stomachs
      in that bedroom. With what inexhaustible energy Miss Ladd's young ladies
      ate and drank! How merrily they enjoyed the delightful privilege of
      talking nonsense! And&mdash;alas! alas!&mdash;how vainly they tried, in
      after life, to renew the once unalloyed enjoyment of tarts and lemonade!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the unintelligible scheme of creation, there appears to be no human
      happiness&mdash;not even the happiness of schoolgirls&mdash;which is ever
      complete. Just as it was drawing to a close, the enjoyment of the feast
      was interrupted by an alarm from the sentinel at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put out the candle!" Priscilla whispered "Somebody on the stairs."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. BIOGRAPHY IN THE BEDROOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The candle was instantly extinguished. In discreet silence the girls stole
      back to their beds, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aid to the vigilance of the sentinel, the door had been left ajar.
      Through the narrow opening, a creaking of the broad wooden stairs of the
      old house became audible. In another moment there was silence. An interval
      passed, and the creaking was heard again. This time, the sound was distant
      and diminishing. On a sudden it stopped. The midnight silence was
      disturbed no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Had one among the many persons in authority under Miss Ladd's roof heard
      the girls talking, and ascended the stairs to surprise them in the act of
      violating one of the rules of the house? So far, such a proceeding was by
      no means uncommon. But was it within the limits of probability that a
      teacher should alter her opinion of her own duty half-way up the stairs,
      and deliberately go back to her own room again? The bare idea of such a
      thing was absurd on the face of it. What more rational explanation could
      ingenuity discover on the spur of the moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was the first to offer a suggestion. She shook and shivered in
      her bed, and said, "For heaven's sake, light the candle again! It's a
      Ghost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clear away the supper, you fools, before the ghost can report us to Miss
      Ladd."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this excellent advice Emily checked the rising panic. The door was
      closed, the candle was lit; all traces of the supper disappeared. For five
      minutes more they listened again. No sound came from the stairs; no
      teacher, or ghost of a teacher, appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having eaten her supper, Cecilia's immediate anxieties were at an end; she
      was at leisure to exert her intelligence for the benefit of her
      schoolfellows. In her gentle ingratiating way, she offered a composing
      suggestion. "When we heard the creaking, I don't believe there was anybody
      on the stairs. In these old houses there are always strange noises at
      night&mdash;and they say the stairs here were made more than two hundred
      years since."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls looked at each other with a sense of relief&mdash;but they
      waited to hear the opinion of the queen. Emily, as usual, justified the
      confidence placed in her. She discovered an ingenious method of putting
      Cecilia's suggestion to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go on talking," she said. "If Cecilia is right, the teachers are
      all asleep, and we have nothing to fear from them. If she's wrong, we
      shall sooner or later see one of them at the door. Don't be alarmed, Miss
      de Sor. Catching us talking at night, in this school, only means a
      reprimand. Catching us with a light, ends in punishment. Blow out the
      candle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine's belief in the ghost was too sincerely superstitious to be
      shaken: she started up in bed. "Oh, don't leave me in the dark! I'll take
      the punishment, if we are found out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On your sacred word of honor?" Emily stipulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen's sense of humor was tickled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something funny," she remarked, addressing her subjects, "in a
      big girl like this coming to a new school and beginning with a punishment.
      May I ask if you are a foreigner, Miss de Sor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My papa is a Spanish gentleman," Francine answered, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your mamma?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mamma is English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have always lived in the West Indies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always lived in the Island of St. Domingo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily checked off on her fingers the different points thus far discovered
      in the character of Mr. de Sor's daughter. "She's ignorant, and
      superstitious, and foreign, and rich. My dear (forgive the familiarity),
      you are an interesting girl&mdash;and we must really know more of you.
      Entertain the bedroom. What have you been about all your life? And what in
      the name of wonder, brings you here? Before you begin I insist on one
      condition, in the name of all the young ladies in the room. No useful
      information about the West Indies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine disappointed her audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ready enough to make herself an object of interest to her
      companions; but she was not possessed of the capacity to arrange events in
      their proper order, necessary to the recital of the simplest narrative.
      Emily was obliged to help her, by means of questions. In one respect, the
      result justified the trouble taken to obtain it. A sufficient reason was
      discovered for the extraordinary appearance of a new pupil, on the day
      before the school closed for the holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de Sor's elder brother had left him an estate in St. Domingo, and a
      fortune in money as well; on the one easy condition that he continued to
      reside in the island. The question of expense being now beneath the notice
      of the family, Francine had been sent to England, especially recommended
      to Miss Ladd as a young lady with grand prospects, sorely in need of a
      fashionable education. The voyage had been so timed, by the advice of the
      schoolmistress, as to make the holidays a means of obtaining this object
      privately. Francine was to be taken to Brighton, where excellent masters
      could be obtained to assist Miss Ladd. With six weeks before her, she
      might in some degree make up for lost time; and, when the school opened
      again, she would avoid the mortification of being put down in the lowest
      class, along with the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The examination of Miss de Sor having produced these results was pursued
      no further. Her character now appeared in a new, and not very attractive,
      light. She audaciously took to herself the whole credit of telling her
      story:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's my turn now," she said, "to be interested and amused. May I
      ask you to begin, Miss Emily? All I know of you at present is, t hat your
      family name is Brown."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily held up her hand for silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the mysterious creaking on the stairs making itself heard once more?
      No. The sound that had caught Emily's quick ear came from the beds, on the
      opposite side of the room, occupied by the three lazy girls. With no new
      alarm to disturb them, Effie, Annis, and Priscilla had yielded to the
      composing influences of a good supper and a warm night. They were fast
      asleep&mdash;and the stoutest of the three (softly, as became a young
      lady) was snoring!
    </p>
    <p>
      The unblemished reputation of the bedroom was dear to Emily, in her
      capacity of queen. She felt herself humiliated in the presence of the new
      pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that fat girl ever gets a lover," she said indignantly, "I shall
      consider it my duty to warn the poor man before he marries her. Her
      ridiculous name is Euphemia. I have christened her (far more
      appropriately) Boiled Veal. No color in her hair, no color in her eyes, no
      color in her complexion. In short, no flavor in Euphemia. You naturally
      object to snoring. Pardon me if I turn my back on you&mdash;I am going to
      throw my slipper at her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft voice of Cecilia&mdash;suspiciously drowsy in tone&mdash;interposed
      in the interests of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can't help it, poor thing; and she really isn't loud enough to
      disturb us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She won't disturb <i>you</i>, at any rate! Rouse yourself, Cecilia. We
      are wide awake on this side of the room&mdash;and Francine says it's our
      turn to amuse her."
    </p>
    <p>
      A low murmur, dying away gently in a sigh, was the only answer. Sweet
      Cecilia had yielded to the somnolent influences of the supper and the
      night. The soft infection of repose seemed to be in some danger of
      communicating itself to Francine. Her large mouth opened luxuriously in a
      long-continued yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night!" said Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss de Sor became wide awake in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said positively; "you are quite mistaken if you think I am going
      to sleep. Please exert yourself, Miss Emily&mdash;I am waiting to be
      interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily appeared to be unwilling to exert herself. She preferred talking of
      the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't the wind rising?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt of it. The leaves in the garden were beginning to
      rustle, and the pattering of the rain sounded on the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine (as her straight chin proclaimed to all students of physiognomy)
      was an obstinate girl. Determined to carry her point she tried Emily's own
      system on Emily herself&mdash;she put questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you been long at this school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than three years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got any brothers and sisters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the only child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are your father and mother alive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily suddenly raised herself in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute," she said; "I think I hear it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The creaking on the stairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Either she was mistaken, or the change for the worse in the weather made
      it not easy to hear slight noises in the house. The wind was still rising.
      The passage of it through the great trees in the garden began to sound
      like the fall of waves on a distant beach. It drove the rain&mdash;a heavy
      downpour by this time&mdash;rattling against the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost a storm, isn't it?" Emily said
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine's last question had not been answered yet. She took the earliest
      opportunity of repeating it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind the weather," she said. "Tell me about your father and mother.
      Are they both alive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's reply only related to one of her parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother died before I was old enough to feel my loss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily referred to another relative&mdash;her father's sister. "Since I
      have grown up," she proceeded, "my good aunt has been a second mother to
      me. My story is, in one respect, the reverse of yours. You are
      unexpectedly rich; and I am unexpectedly poor. My aunt's fortune was to
      have been my fortune, if I outlived her. She has been ruined by the
      failure of a bank. In her old age, she must live on an income of two
      hundred a year&mdash;and I must get my own living when I leave school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely your father can help you?" Francine persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His property is landed property." Her voice faltered, as she referred to
      him, even in that indirect manner. "It is entailed; his nearest male
      relative inherits it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicacy which is easily discouraged was not one of the weaknesses in
      the nature of Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I understand that your father is dead?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our thick-skinned fellow-creatures have the rest of us at their mercy:
      only give them time, and they carry their point in the end. In sad subdued
      tones&mdash;telling of deeply-rooted reserves of feeling, seldom revealed
      to strangers&mdash;Emily yielded at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said, "my father is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some people might think it long ago. I was very fond of my father. It's
      nearly four years since he died, and my heart still aches when I think of
      him. I'm not easily depressed by troubles, Miss de Sor. But his death was
      sudden&mdash;he was in his grave when I first heard of it&mdash;and&mdash;Oh,
      he was so good to me; he was so good to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The gay high-spirited little creature who took the lead among them all&mdash;who
      was the life and soul of the school&mdash;hid her face in her hands, and
      burst out crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled and&mdash;to do her justice&mdash;ashamed, Francine attempted to
      make excuses. Emily's generous nature passed over the cruel persistency
      that had tortured her. "No no; I have nothing to forgive. It isn't your
      fault. Other girls have not mothers and brothers and sisters&mdash;and get
      reconciled to such a loss as mine. Don't make excuses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but I want you to know that I feel for you," Francine insisted,
      without the slightest approach to sympathy in face, voice, or manner.
      "When my uncle died, and left us all the money, papa was much shocked. He
      trusted to time to help him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time has been long about it with me, Francine. I am afraid there is
      something perverse in my nature; the hope of meeting again in a better
      world seems so faint and so far away. No more of it now! Let us talk of
      that good creature who is asleep on the other side of you. Did I tell you
      that I must earn my own bread when I leave school? Well, Cecilia has
      written home and found an employment for me. Not a situation as governess&mdash;something
      quite out of the common way. You shall hear all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the brief interval that had passed, the weather had begun to change
      again. The wind was as high as ever; but to judge by the lessening patter
      on the windows the rain was passing away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too grateful to her friend and school-fellow, and too deeply
      interested in her story, to notice the air of indifference with which
      Francine settled herself on her pillow to hear the praises of Cecilia. The
      most beautiful girl in the school was not an object of interest to a young
      lady with an obstinate chin and unfortunately-placed eyes. Pouring warm
      from the speaker's heart the story ran smoothly on, to the monotonous
      accompaniment of the moaning wind. By fine degrees Francine's eyes closed,
      opened and closed again. Toward the latter part of the narrative Emily's
      memory became, for the moment only, confused between two events. She
      stopped to consider&mdash;noticed Francine's silence, in an interval when
      she might have said a word of encouragement&mdash;and looked closer at
      her. Miss de Sor was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She might have told me she was tired," Emily said to herself quietly.
      "Well! the best thing I can do is to put out the light and follow her
      example."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she took up the extinguisher, the bedroom door was suddenly opened from
      the outer side. A tall woman, robed in a black dressing-gown, stood on the
      threshold, looking at Emily.

      The woman's lean, long-fingered hand pointed to the candle.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Don't put it out." Saying those words, she looked round the room, and
      satisfied herself that the other girls were asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily laid down the extinguisher. "You mean to report us, of course," she
      said. "I am the only one awake, Miss Jethro; lay the blame on me."

      "I have no intention of reporting you. But I have something to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and pushed her thick black hair (already streaked with gray)
      back from her temples. Her eyes, large and dark and dim, rested on Emily
      with a sorrowful interest. "When your young friends wake to-morrow
      morning," she went on, "you can tell them that the new teacher, whom
      nobody likes, has left the school."
    </p>
    <p>
      For once, even quick-witted Emily was bewildered. "Going away," she said,
      "when you have only been here since Easter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro advanced, not noticing Emily's expression of surprise. "I am
      not very strong at the best of times," she continued, "may I sit down on
      your bed?" Remarkable on other occasions for her cold composure, her voice
      trembled as she made that request&mdash;a strange request surely, when
      there were chairs at her disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily made room for her with the dazed look of a girl in a dream. "I beg
      your pardon, Miss Jethro, one of the things I can't endure is being
      puzzled. If you don't mean to report us, why did you come in and catch me
      with the light?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro's explanation was far from relieving the perplexity which her
      conduct had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been mean enough," she answered, "to listen at the door, and I
      heard you talking of your father. I want to hear more about him. That is
      why I came in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew my father!" Emily exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I knew him. But his name is so common&mdash;there are so many
      thousands of 'James Browns' in England&mdash;that I am in fear of making a
      mistake. I heard you say that he died nearly four years since. Can you
      mention any particulars which might help to enlighten me? If you think I
      am taking a liberty&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stopped her. "I would help you if I could," she said. "But I was in
      poor health at the time; and I was staying with friends far away in
      Scotland, to try change of air. The news of my father's death brought on a
      relapse. Weeks passed before I was strong enough to travel&mdash;weeks and
      weeks before I saw his grave! I can only tell you what I know from my
      aunt. He died of heart-complaint."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked at her for the first time, with eyes that betrayed a feeling
      of distrust. "What have I said to startle you?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing! I am nervous in stormy weather&mdash;don't notice me." She went
      on abruptly with her inquiries. "Will you tell me the date of your
      father's death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The date was the thirtieth of September, nearly four years since."
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, after that reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this," Emily continued, "is the thirtieth of June, eighteen hundred
      and eighty-one. You can now judge for yourself. Did you know my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro answered mechanically, using the same words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did know your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's feeling of distrust was not set at rest. "I never heard him speak
      of you," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her younger days the teacher must have been a handsome woman. Her
      grandly-formed features still suggested the idea of imperial beauty&mdash;perhaps
      Jewish in its origin. When Emily said, "I never heard him speak of you,"
      the color flew into her pallid cheeks: her dim eyes became alive again
      with a momentary light. She left her seat on the bed, and, turning away,
      mastered the emotion that shook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How hot the night is!" she said: and sighed, and resumed the subject with
      a steady countenance. "I am not surprised that your father never mentioned
      me&mdash;to <i>you</i>." She spoke quietly, but her face was paler than
      ever. She sat down again on the bed. "Is there anything I can do for you,"
      she asked, "before I go away? Oh, I only mean some trifling service that
      would lay you under no obligation, and would not oblige you to keep up
      your acquaintance with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes&mdash;the dim black eyes that must once have been irresistibly
      beautiful&mdash;looked at Emily so sadly that the generous girl reproached
      herself for having doubted her father's friend. "Are you thinking of <i>him</i>,"
      she said gently, "when you ask if you can be of service to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro made no direct reply. "You were fond of your father?" she
      added, in a whisper. "You told your schoolfellow that your heart still
      aches when you speak of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only told her the truth," Emily answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro shuddered&mdash;on that hot night!&mdash;shuddered as if a
      chill had struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily held out her hand; the kind feeling that had been roused in her
      glittered prettily in her eyes. "I am afraid I have not done you justice,"
      she said. "Will you forgive me and shake hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro rose, and drew back. "Look at the light!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle was all burned out. Emily still offered her hand&mdash;and
      still Miss Jethro refused to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is just light enough left," she said, "to show me my way to the
      door. Good-night&mdash;and good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily caught at her dress, and stopped her. "Why won't you shake hands
      with me?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wick of the candle fell over in the socket, and left them in the dark.
      Emily resolutely held the teacher's dress. With or without light, she was
      still bent on making Miss Jethro explain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had throughout spoken in guarded tones, fearing to disturb the
      sleeping girls. The sudden darkness had its inevitable effect. Their
      voices sank to whispers now. "My father's friend," Emily pleaded, "is
      surely my friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drop the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can never be <i>my</i> friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's sense of self-respect forbade her to persist any longer. "I beg
      your pardon for having kept you here against your will," she said&mdash;and
      dropped her hold on the dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro instantly yielded on her side. "I am sorry to have been
      obstinate," she answered. "If you do despise me, it is after all no more
      than I have deserved." Her hot breath beat on Emily's face: the unhappy
      woman must have bent over the bed as she made her confession. "I am not a
      fit person for you to associate with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro sighed bitterly. "Young and warm hearted&mdash;I was once like
      you!" She controlled that outburst of despair. Her next words were spoken
      in steadier tones. "You <i>will</i> have it&mdash;you <i>shall</i> have
      it!" she said. "Some one (in this house or out of it; I don't know which)
      has betrayed me to the mistress of the school. A wretch in my situation
      suspects everybody, and worse still, does it without reason or excuse. I
      heard you girls talking when you ought to have been asleep. You all
      dislike me. How did I know it mightn't be one of you? Absurd, to a person
      with a well-balanced mind! I went halfway up the stairs, and felt ashamed
      of myself, and went back to my room. If I could only have got some rest!
      Ah, well, it was not to be done. My own vile suspicions kept me awake; I
      left my bed again. You know what I heard on the other side of that door,
      and why I was interested in hearing it. Your father never told me he had a
      daughter. 'Miss Brown,' at this school, was any 'Miss Brown,' to me. I had
      no idea of who you really were until to-night. I'm wandering. What does
      all this matter to you? Miss Ladd has been merciful; she lets me go
      without exposing me. You can guess what has happened. No? Not even yet? Is
      it innocence or kindness that makes you so slow to understand? My dear, I
      have obtained admission to this respectable house by means of false
      references, and I have been discovered. <i>Now</i> you know why you must
      not be the friend of such a woman as I am! Once more, good-night&mdash;and
      good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily shrank from that miserable farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bid me good-night," she said, "but don't bid me good-by. Let me see you
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the softly-closed door was just audible in the darkness. She
      had spoken&mdash;she had gone&mdash;never to be seen by Emily again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miserable, interesting, unfathomable creature&mdash;the problem that night
      of Emily's waking thoughts: the phantom of her dreams. "Bad? or good?" she
      asked herself. "False; for she listened at the door. True; for she told me
      the tale of her own disgrace. A friend of my father; and she never knew
      that he had a daughter. Refined, accomplished, lady-like; and she stoops
      to use a false reference. Who is to reconcile such contradictions as
      these?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawn looked in at the window&mdash;dawn of the memorable day which was,
      for Emily, the beginning of a new life. The years were before her; and the
      years in their course reveal baffling mysteries of life and death.

      CHAPTER IV. MISS LADD'S DRAWING-MASTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Francine was awakened the next morning by one of the housemaids, bringing
      up her breakfast on a tray. Astonished at this concession to laziness, in
      an institution devoted to the practice of all virtues, she looked round.
      The bedroom was deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other young ladies are as busy as bees, miss," the housemaid
      explained. "They were up and dressed two hours ago: and the breakfast has
      been cleared away long since. It's Miss Emily's fault. She wouldn't allow
      them to wake you; she said you could be of no possible use downstairs, and
      you had better be treated like a visitor. Miss Cecilia was so distressed
      at your missing your breakfast that she spoke to the housekeeper, and I
      was sent up to you. Please to excuse it if the tea's cold. This is Grand
      Day, and we are all topsy-turvy in consequence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Inquiring what "Grand Day" meant, and why it produced this extraordinary
      result in a ladies' school, Francine discovered that the first day of the
      vacation was devoted to the distribution of prizes, in the presence of
      parents, guardians and friends. An Entertainment was added, comprising
      those merciless tests of human endurance called Recitations; light
      refreshments and musical performances being distributed at intervals, to
      encourage the exhausted audience. The local newspaper sent a reporter to
      describe the proceedings, and some of Miss Ladd's young ladies enjoyed the
      intoxicating luxury of seeing their names in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It begins at three o'clock," the housemaid went on, "and, what with
      practicing and rehearsing, and ornamenting the schoolroom, there's a
      hubbub fit to make a person's head spin. Besides which," said the girl,
      lowering her voice, and approaching a little nearer to Francine, "we have
      all been taken by surprise. The first thing in the morning Miss Jethro
      left us, without saying good-by to anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Miss Jethro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The new teacher, miss. We none of us liked her, and we all suspect
      there's something wrong. Miss Ladd and the clergyman had a long talk
      together yesterday (in private, you know), and they sent for Miss Jethro&mdash;which
      looks bad, doesn't it? Is there anything more I can do for you, miss? It's
      a beautiful day after the rain. If I was you, I should go and enjoy myself
      in the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished her breakfast, Francine decided on profiting by this
      sensible suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant who showed her the way to the garden was not favorably
      impressed by the new pupil: Francine's temper asserted itself a little too
      plainly in her face. To a girl possessing a high opinion of her own
      importance it was not very agreeable to feel herself excluded, as an
      illiterate stranger, from the one absorbing interest of her schoolfellows.
      "Will the time ever come," she wondered bitterly, "when I shall win a
      prize, and sing and play before all the company? How I should enjoy making
      the girls envy me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A broad lawn, overshadowed at one end by fine old trees&mdash;flower beds
      and shrubberies, and winding paths prettily and invitingly laid out&mdash;made
      the garden a welcome refuge on that fine summer morning. The novelty of
      the scene, after her experience in the West Indies, the delicious breezes
      cooled by the rain of the night, exerted their cheering influence even on
      the sullen disposition of Francine. She smiled, in spite of herself, as
      she followed the pleasant paths, and heard the birds singing their summer
      songs over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering among the trees, which occupied a considerable extent of ground,
      she passed into an open space beyond, and discovered an old fish-pond,
      overgrown by aquatic plants. Driblets of water trickled from a dilapidated
      fountain in the middle. On the further side of the pond the ground sloped
      downward toward the south, and revealed, over a low paling, a pretty view
      of a village and its church, backed by fir woods mounting the heathy sides
      of a range of hills beyond. A fanciful little wooden building, imitating
      the form of a Swiss cottage, was placed so as to command the prospect.
      Near it, in the shadow of the building, stood a rustic chair and table&mdash;with
      a color-box on one, and a portfolio on the other. Fluttering over the
      grass, at the mercy of the capricious breeze, was a neglected sheet of
      drawing-paper. Francine ran round the pond, and picked up the paper just
      as it was on the point of being tilted into the water. It contained a
      sketch in water colors of the village and the woods, and Francine had
      looked at the view itself with indifference&mdash;the picture of the view
      interested her. Ordinary visitors to Galleries of Art, which admit
      students, show the same strange perversity. The work of the copyist
      commands their whole attention; they take no interest in the original
      picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up from the sketch, Francine was startled. She discovered a man,
      at the window of the Swiss summer-house, watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have done with that drawing," he said quietly, "please let me
      have it back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tall and thin and dark. His finely-shaped intelligent face&mdash;hidden,
      as to the lower part of it, by a curly black beard&mdash;would have been
      absolutely handsome, even in the eyes of a schoolgirl, but for the deep
      furrows that marked it prematurely between the eyebrows, and at the sides
      of the mouth. In the same way, an underlying mockery impaired the
      attraction of his otherwise refined and gentle manner. Among his
      fellow-creatures, children and dogs were the only critics who appreciated
      his merits without discovering the defects which lessened the favorable
      appreciation of him by men and women. He dressed neatly, but his morning
      coat was badly made, and his picturesque felt hat was too old. In short,
      there seemed to be no good quality about him which was not perversely
      associated with a drawback of some kind. He was one of those harmless and
      luckless men, possessed of excellent qualities, who fail nevertheless to
      achieve popularity in their social sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine handed his sketch to him, through the window; doubtful whether
      the words that he had addressed to her were spoken in jest or in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only presumed to touch your drawing," she said, "because it was in
      danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What danger?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine pointed to the pond. "If I had not been in time to pick it up, it
      would have been blown into the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it was worth picking up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting that question, he looked first at the sketch&mdash;then at the
      view which it represented&mdash;then back again at the sketch. The corners
      of his mouth turned upward with a humorous expression of scorn. "Madam
      Nature," he said, "I beg your pardon." With those words, he composedly
      tore his work of art into small pieces, and scattered them out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity!" said Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He joined her on the ground outside the cottage. "Why is it a pity?" he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a nice drawing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't a nice drawing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not very polite, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her&mdash;and sighed as if he pitied so young a woman for
      having a temper so ready to take offense. In his flattest contradictions
      he always preserved the character of a politely-positive man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put it in plain words, miss," he replied. "I have offended the
      predominant sense in your nature&mdash;your sense of self-esteem. You
      don't like to be told, even indirectly, that you know nothing of Art. In
      these days, everybody knows everything&mdash;and thinks nothing worth
      knowing after all. But beware how you presume on an appearance of
      indifference, which is nothing but conceit in disguise. The ruling passion
      of civilized humanity is, Conceit. You may try the regard of your dearest
      friend in any other way, and be forgiven. Ruffle the smooth surface of
      your friend's self-esteem&mdash;and there will be an acknowledged coolness
      between you which will last for life. Excuse me for giving you the benefit
      of my trumpery experience. This sort of smart talk is <i>my</i> form of
      conceit. Can I be of use to you in some better way? Are you looking for
      one of our young ladies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine began to feel a certain reluctant interest in him when he spoke
      of "our young ladies." She asked if he belonged to the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corners of his mouth turned up again. "I'm one of the masters," he
      said. "Are <i>you</i> going to belong to the school, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine bent her head, with a gravity and condescension intended to keep
      him at his proper distance. Far from being discouraged, he permitted his
      curiosity to take additional liberties. "Are you to have the misfortune of
      being one of my pupils?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know who you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be much wiser when you do know. My name is Alban Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine corrected herself. "I mean, I don't know what you teach."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban Morris pointed to the fragments of his sketch from Nature. "I am a
      bad artist," he said. "Some bad artists become Royal Academicians. Some
      take to drink. Some get a pension. And some&mdash;I am one of them&mdash;find
      refuge in schools. Drawing is an 'Extra' at this school. Will you take my
      advice? Spare your good father's pocket; say you don't want to learn to
      draw."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so gravely in earnest that Francine burst out laughing. "You are a
      strange man," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong again, miss. I am only an unhappy man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The furrows in his face deepened, the latent humor died out of his eyes.
      He turned to the summer-house window, and took up a pipe and tobacco
      pouch, left on the ledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I lost my only friend last year," he said. "Since the death of my dog, my
      pipe is the one companion I have left. Naturally I am not allowed to enjoy
      the honest fellow's society in the presence of ladies. They have their own
      taste in perfumes. Their clothes and their letters reek with the foetid
      secretion of the musk deer. The clean vegetable smell of tobacco is
      unendurable to them. Allow me to retire&mdash;and let me thank you for the
      trouble you took to save my drawing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of indifference in which he expressed his gratitude piqued
      Francine. She resented it by drawing her own conclusion from what he had
      said of the ladies and the musk deer. "I was wrong in admiring your
      drawing," she remarked; "and wrong again in thinking you a strange man. Am
      I wrong, for the third time, in believing that you dislike women?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to say you are right," Alban Morris answered gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there not even one exception?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant the words passed her lips, she saw that there was some
      secretly sensitive feeling in him which she had hurt. His black brows
      gathered into a frown, his piercing eyes looked at her with angry
      surprise. It was over in a moment. He raised his shabby hat, and made her
      a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a sore place still left in me," he said; "and you have
      innocently hit it. Good-morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could speak again, he had turned the corner of the
      summer-house, and was lost to view in a shrubbery on the westward side of
      the grounds.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. DISCOVERIES IN THE GARDEN.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Left by herself, Miss de Sor turned back again by way of the trees.
    </h3>
    <p>
      So far, her interview with the drawing-master had helped to pass the time.
      Some girls might have found it no easy task to arrive at a true view of
      the character of Alban Morris. Francine's essentially superficial
      observation set him down as "a little mad," and left him there, judged and
      dismissed to her own entire satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the lawn, she discovered Emily pacing backward and forward,
      with her head down and her hands behind her, deep in thought. Francine's
      high opinion of herself would have carried her past any of the other
      girls, unless they had made special advances to her. She stopped and
      looked at Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the sad fate of little women in general to grow too fat and to be
      born with short legs. Emily's slim finely-strung figure spoke for itself
      as to the first of these misfortunes, and asserted its happy freedom from
      the second, if she only walked across a room. Nature had built her, from
      head to foot, on a skeleton-scaffolding in perfect proportion. Tall or
      short matters little to the result, in women who possess the first and
      foremost advantage of beginning well in their bones. When they live to old
      age, they often astonish thoughtless men, who walk behind them in the
      street. "I give you my honor, she was as easy and upright as a young girl;
      and when you got in front of her and looked&mdash;white hair, and seventy
      years of age."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine approached Emily, moved by a rare impulse in her nature&mdash;the
      impulse to be sociable. "You look out of spirits," she began. "Surely you
      don't regret leaving school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In her present mood, Emily took the opportunity (in the popular phrase) of
      snubbing Francine. "You have guessed wrong; I do regret," she answered. "I
      have found in Cecilia my dearest friend at school. And school brought with
      it the change in my life which has helped me to bear the loss of my
      father. If you must know what I was thinking of just now, I was thinking
      or my aunt. She has not answered my last letter&mdash;and I'm beginning to
      be afraid she is ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very sorry," said Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? You don't know my aunt; and you have only known me since yesterday
      afternoon. Why are you sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine remained silent. Without realizing it, she was beginning to feel
      the dominant influence that Emily exercised over the weaker natures that
      came in contact with her. To find herself irresistibly attracted by a
      stranger at a new school&mdash;an unfortunate little creature, whose
      destiny was to earn her own living&mdash;filled the narrow mind of Miss de
      Sor with perplexity. Having waited in vain for a reply, Emily turned away,
      and resumed the train of thought which her schoolfellow had interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      By an association of ideas, of which she was not herself aware, she now
      passed from thinking of her aunt to thinking of Miss Jethro. The interview
      of the previous night had dwelt on her mind at intervals, in the hours of
      the new day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting on instinct rather than on reason, she had kept that remarkable
      incident in her school life a secret from every one. No discoveries had
      been made by other persons. In speaking to her staff of teachers, Miss
      Ladd had alluded to the affair in the most cautious terms. "Circumstances
      of a private nature have obliged the lady to retire from my school. When
      we meet after the holidays, another teacher will be in her place." There,
      Miss Ladd's explanation had begun and ended. Inquiries addressed to the
      servants had led to no result. Miss Jethro's luggage was to be forwarded
      to the London terminus of the railway&mdash;and Miss Jethro herself had
      baffled investigation by leaving the school on foot. Emily's interest in
      the lost teacher was not the transitory interest of curiosity; her
      father's mysterious friend was a person whom she honestly desired to see
      again. Perplexed by the difficulty of finding a means of tracing Miss
      Jethro, she reached the shady limit of the trees, and turned to walk back
      again. Approaching the place at which she and Francine had met, an idea
      occurred to her. It was just possible that Miss Jethro might not be
      unknown to her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still meditating on the cold reception that she had encountered, and still
      feeling the influence which mastered her in spite of herself, Francine
      interpreted Emily's return as an implied expression of regret. She
      advanced with a constrained smile, and spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are the young ladies getting on in the schoolroom?" she asked, by way
      of renewing the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's face assumed a look of surprise which said plainly, Can't you take
      a hint and leave me to myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was constitutionally impenetrable to reproof of this sort; her
      thick skin was not even tickled. "Why are you not helping them," she went
      on; "you who have the clearest head among us and take the lead in
      everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be a humiliating confession to make, yet it is surely true that we
      are all accessible to flattery. Different tastes appreciate different
      methods of burning incense&mdash;but the perfume is more or less agreeable
      to all varieties of noses. Francine's method had its tranquilizing effect
      on Emily. She answered indulgently, "Miss de Sor, I have nothing to do
      with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to do with it? No prizes to win before you leave school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won all the prizes years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there are recitations. Surely you recite?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmless words in themselves, pursuing the same smooth course of flattery
      as before&mdash;but with what a different result! Emily's face reddened
      with anger the moment they were spoken. Having already irritated Alban
      Morris, unlucky Francine, by a second mischievous interposition of
      accident, had succeeded in making Emily smart next. "Who has told you,"
      she burst out; "I insist on knowing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody has told me anything!" Francine declared piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody has told you how I have been insulted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed! Oh, Miss Brown, who could insult <i>you?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a man, the sense of injury does sometimes submit to the discipline of
      silence. In a woman&mdash;never. Suddenly reminded of her past wrongs (by
      the pardonable error of a polite schoolfellow), Emily committed the
      startling inconsistency of appealing to the sympathies of Francine!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you believe it? I have been forbidden to recite&mdash;I, the head
      girl of the school. Oh, not to-day! It happened a month ago&mdash;when we
      were all in consultation, making our arrangements. Miss Ladd asked me if I
      had decided on a piece to recite. I said, 'I have not only decided, I have
      learned the piece.' 'And what may it be?' 'The dagger-scene in Macbeth.'
      There was a howl&mdash;I can call it by no other name&mdash;a howl of
      indignation. A man's soliloquy, and, worse still, a murdering man's
      soliloquy, recited by one of Miss Ladd's young ladies, before an audience
      of parents and guardians! That was the tone they took with me. I was as
      firm as a rock. The dagger-scene or nothing. The result is&mdash;nothing!
      An insult to Shakespeare, and an insult to Me. I felt it&mdash;I feel it
      still. I was prepared for any sacrifice in the cause of the drama. If Miss
      Ladd had met me in a proper spirit, do you know what I would have done? I
      would have played Macbeth in costume. Just hear me, and judge for
      yourself. I begin with a dreadful vacancy in my eyes, and a hollow moaning
      in my voice: 'Is this a dagger that I see before me&mdash;?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Reciting with her face toward the trees, Emily started, dropped the
      character of Macbeth, and instantly became herself again: herself, with a
      rising color and an angry brightening of the eyes. "Excuse me, I can't
      trust my memory: I must get the play." With that abrupt apology, she
      walked away rapidly in the direction of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some surprise, Francine turned, and looked at the trees. She discovered&mdash;in
      full retreat, on his side&mdash;the eccentric drawing-master, Alban
      Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he, too, admire the dagger-scene? And was he modestly desirous of
      hearing it recited, without showing himself? In that case, why should
      Emily (whose besetting weakness was certainly not want of confidence in
      her own resources) leave the garden the moment she caught sight of him?
      Francine consulted her instincts. She had just arrived at a conclusion
      which expressed itself outwardly by a malicious smile, when gentle Cecilia
      appeared on the lawn&mdash;a lovable object in a broad straw hat and a
      white dress, with a nosegay in her bosom&mdash;smiling, and fanning
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so hot in the schoolroom," she said, "and some of the girls, poor
      things, are so ill-tempered at rehearsal&mdash;I have made my escape. I
      hope you got your breakfast, Miss de Sor. What have you been doing here,
      all by yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been making an interesting discovery," Francine replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An interesting discovery in our garden? What <i>can</i> it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The drawing-master, my dear, is in love with Emily. Perhaps she doesn't
      care about him. Or, perhaps, I have been an innocent obstacle in the way
      of an appointment between them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia had breakfasted to her heart's content on her favorite dish&mdash;buttered
      eggs. She was in such good spirits that she was inclined to be coquettish,
      even when there was no man present to fascinate. "We are not allowed to
      talk about love in this school," she said&mdash;and hid her face behind
      her fan. "Besides, if it came to Miss Ladd's ears, poor Mr. Morris might
      lose his situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it true?" asked Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be true, my dear; but nobody knows. Emily hasn't breathed a word
      about it to any of us. And Mr. Morris keeps his own secret. Now and then
      we catch him looking at her&mdash;and we draw our own conclusions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you meet Emily on your way here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and she passed without speaking to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thinking perhaps of Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia shook her head. "Thinking, Francine, of the new life before her&mdash;and
      regretting, I am afraid, that she ever confided her hopes and wishes to
      me. Did she tell you last night what her prospects are when she leaves
      school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She told me you had been very kind in helping her. I daresay I should
      have heard more, if I had not fallen asleep. What is she going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To live in a dull house, far away in the north," Cecilia answered; "with
      only old people in it. She will have to write and translate for a great
      scholar, who is studying mysterious inscriptions&mdash;hieroglyphics, I
      think they are called&mdash;found among the ruins of Central America. It's
      really no laughing matter, Francine! Emily made a joke of it, too. 'I'll
      take anything but a situation as a governess,' she said; 'the children who
      have Me to teach them would be to be pitied indeed!' She begged and prayed
      me to help her to get an honest living. What could I do? I could only
      write home to papa. He is a member of Parliament: and everybody who wants
      a place seems to think he is bound to find it for them. As it happened, he
      had heard from an old friend of his (a certain Sir Jervis Redwood), who
      was in search of a secretary. Being in favor of letting the women compete
      for employment with the men, Sir Jervis was willing to try, what he calls,
      'a female.' Isn't that a horrid way of speaking of us? and Miss Ladd says
      it's ungrammatical, besides. Papa had written back to say he knew of no
      lady whom he could recommend. When he got my letter speaking of Emily, he
      kindly wrote again. In the interval, Sir Jervis had received two
      applications for the vacant place. They were both from old ladies&mdash;and
      he declined to employ them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they were old," Francine suggested maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear him give his own reasons, my dear. Papa sent me an extract
      from his letter. It made me rather angry; and (perhaps for that reason) I
      think I can repeat it word for word:&mdash;'We are four old people in this
      house, and we don't want a fifth. Let us have a young one to cheer us. If
      your daughter's friend likes the terms, and is not encumbered with a
      sweetheart, I will send for her when the school breaks up at midsummer.'
      Coarse and selfish&mdash;isn't it? However, Emily didn't agree with me,
      when I showed her the extract. She accepted the place, very much to her
      aunt's surprise and regret, when that excellent person heard of it. Now
      that the time has come (though Emily won't acknowledge it), I believe she
      secretly shrinks, poor dear, from the prospect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely," Francine agreed&mdash;without even a pretense of sympathy.
      "But tell me, who are the four old people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, Sir Jervis himself&mdash;seventy, last birthday. Next, his
      unmarried sister&mdash;nearly eighty. Next, his man-servant, Mr. Rook&mdash;well
      past sixty. And last, his man-servant's wife, who considers herself young,
      being only a little over forty. That is the household. Mrs. Rook is coming
      to-day to attend Emily on the journey to the North; and I am not at all
      sure that Emily will like her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A disagreeable woman, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;not exactly that. Rather odd and flighty. The fact is, Mrs. Rook
      has had her troubles; and perhaps they have a little unsettled her. She
      and her husband used to keep the village inn, close to our park: we know
      all about them at home. I am sure I pity these poor people. What are you
      looking at, Francine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling no sort of interest in Mr. and Mrs. Rook, Francine was studying
      her schoolfellow's lovely face in search of defects. She had already
      discovered that Cecilia's eyes were placed too widely apart, and that her
      chin wanted size and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was admiring your complexion, dear," she answered coolly. "Well, and
      why do you pity the Rooks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple Cecilia smiled, and went on with her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are obliged to go out to service in their old age, through a
      misfortune for which they are in no way to blame. Their customers deserted
      the inn, and Mr. Rook became bankrupt. The inn got what they call a bad
      name&mdash;in a very dreadful way. There was a murder committed in the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A murder?" cried Francine. "Oh, this is exciting! You provoking girl, why
      didn't you tell me about it before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think of it," said Cecilia placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do go on! Were you at home when it happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I w as here, at school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw the newspapers, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Ladd doesn't allow us to read newspapers. I did hear of it, however,
      in letters from home. Not that there was much in the letters. They said it
      was too horrible to be described. The poor murdered gentleman&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was unaffectedly shocked. "A gentleman!" she exclaimed. "How
      dreadful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor man was a stranger in our part of the country," Cecilia resumed;
      "and the police were puzzled about the motive for a murder. His pocketbook
      was missing; but his watch and his rings were found on the body. I
      remember the initials on his linen because they were the same as my
      mother's initial before she was married&mdash;'J. B.' Really, Francine,
      that's all I know about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely you know whether the murderer was discovered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes&mdash;of course I know that! The government offered a reward; and
      clever people were sent from London to help the county police. Nothing
      came of it. The murderer has never been discovered, from that time to
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did it happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happened in the autumn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The autumn of last year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! Nearly four years since."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. ON THE WAY TO THE VILLAGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alban Morris&mdash;discovered by Emily in concealment among the trees&mdash;was
      not content with retiring to another part of the grounds. He pursued his
      retreat, careless in what direction it might take him, to a footpath
      across the fields, which led to the highroad and the railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd's drawing-master was in that state of nervous irritability which
      seeks relief in rapidity of motion. Public opinion in the neighborhood
      (especially public opinion among the women) had long since decided that
      his manners were offensive, and his temper incurably bad. The men who
      happened to pass him on the footpath said "Good-morning" grudgingly. The
      women took no notice of him&mdash;with one exception. She was young and
      saucy, and seeing him walking at the top of his speed on the way to the
      railway station, she called after him, "Don't be in a hurry, sir! You're
      in plenty of time for the London train."
    </p>
    <p>
      To her astonishment he suddenly stopped. His reputation for rudeness was
      so well established that she moved away to a safe distance, before she
      ventured to look at him again. He took no notice of her&mdash;he seemed to
      be considering with himself. The frolicsome young woman had done him a
      service: she had suggested an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose I go to London?" he thought. "Why not?&mdash;the school is
      breaking up for the holidays&mdash;and <i>she</i> is going away like the
      rest of them." He looked round in the direction of the schoolhouse. "If I
      go back to wish her good-by, she will keep out of my way, and part with me
      at the last moment like a stranger. After my experience of women, to be in
      love again&mdash;in love with a girl who is young enough to be my daughter&mdash;what
      a fool, what a driveling, degraded fool I must be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hot tears rose in his eyes. He dashed them away savagely, and went on
      again faster than ever&mdash;resolved to pack up at once at his lodgings
      in the village, and to take his departure by the next train.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the point where the footpath led into the road, he came to a standstill
      for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause was once more a person of the sex associated in his mind with a
      bitter sense of injury. On this occasion the person was only a miserable
      little child, crying over the fragments of a broken jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban Morris looked at her with his grimly humorous smile. "So you've
      broken a jug?" he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And spilt father's beer," the child answered. Her frail little body shook
      with terror. "Mother'll beat me when I go home," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does mother do when you bring the jug back safe and sound?" Alban
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gives me bren-butter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Now listen to me. Mother shall give you bread and butter again
      this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child stared at him with the tears suspended in her eyes. He went on
      talking to her as seriously as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You understand what I have just said to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got a pocket-handkerchief?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then dry your eyes with mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed his handkerchief to her with one hand, and picked up a fragment
      of the broken jug with the other. "This will do for a pattern," he said to
      himself. The child stared at the handkerchief&mdash;stared at Alban&mdash;took
      courage&mdash;and rubbed vigorously at her eyes. The instinct, which is
      worth all the reason that ever pretended to enlighten mankind&mdash;the
      instinct that never deceives&mdash;told this little ignorant creature that
      she had found a friend. She returned the handkerchief in grave silence.
      Alban took her up in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your eyes are dry, and your face is fit to be seen," he said. "Will you
      give me a kiss?" The child gave him a resolute kiss, with a smack in it.
      "Now come and get another jug," he said, as he put her down. Her red round
      eyes opened wide in alarm. "Have you got money enough?" she asked. Alban
      slapped his pocket. "Yes, I have," he answered. "That's a good thing,"
      said the child; "come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went together hand in hand to the village, and bought the new jug,
      and had it filled at the beer-shop. The thirsty father was at the upper
      end of the fields, where they were making a drain. Alban carried the jug
      until they were within sight of the laborer. "You haven't far to go," he
      said. "Mind you don't drop it again&mdash;What's the matter now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm frightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, give me the jug."
    </p>
    <p>
      She almost snatched it out of his hand. If she let the precious minutes
      slip away, there might be another beating in store for her at the drain:
      her father was not of an indulgent disposition when his children were late
      in bringing his beer. On the point of hurrying away, without a word of
      farewell, she remembered the laws of politeness as taught at the infant
      school&mdash;and dropped her little curtsey&mdash;and said, "Thank you,
      sir." That bitter sense of injury was still in Alban's mind as he looked
      after her. "What a pity she should grow up to be a woman!" he said to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adventure of the broken jug had delayed his return to his lodgings by
      more than half an hour. When he reached the road once more, the cheap
      up-train from the North had stopped at the station. He heard the ringing
      of the bell as it resumed the journey to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the passengers (judging by the handbag that she carried) had not
      stopped at the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she advanced toward him along the road, he remarked that she was a
      small wiry active woman&mdash;dressed in bright colors, combined with a
      deplorable want of taste. Her aquiline nose seemed to be her most striking
      feature as she came nearer. It might have been fairly proportioned to the
      rest of her face, in her younger days, before her cheeks had lost flesh
      and roundness. Being probably near-sighted, she kept her eyes half-closed;
      there were cunning little wrinkles at the corners of them. In spite of
      appearances, she was unwilling to present any outward acknowledgment of
      the march of time. Her hair was palpably dyed&mdash;her hat was jauntily
      set on her head, and ornamented with a gay feather. She walked with a
      light tripping step, swinging her bag, and holding her head up smartly.
      Her manner, like her dress, said as plainly as words could speak, "No
      matter how long I may have lived, I mean to be young and charming to the
      end of my days." To Alban's surprise she stopped and addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I beg your pardon. Could you tell me if I am in the right road to
      Miss Ladd's school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with nervous rapidity of articulation, and with a singularly
      unpleasant smile. It parted her thin lips just widely enough to show her
      suspiciously beautiful teeth; and it opened her keen gray eyes in the
      strangest manner. The higher lid rose so as to disclose, for a moment, the
      upper part of the eyeball, and to give her the appearance&mdash;not of a
      woman bent on making herself agreeable, but of a woman staring in a panic
      of terror. Careless to conceal the unfavorable impression that she had
      produced on him, Alban answered roughly, "Straight on," and tried to pass
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him with a peremptory gesture. "I have treated you politely,"
      she said, "and how do you treat me in return? Well! I am not surprised.
      Men are all brutes by nature&mdash;and you are a man. 'Straight on'?" she
      repeated contemptuously; "I should like to know how far that helps a
      person in a strange place. Perhaps you know no more where Miss Ladd's
      school is than I do? or, perhaps, you don't care to take the trouble of
      addressing me? Just what I should have expected from a person of your sex!
      Good-morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban felt the reproof; she had appealed to his most readily-impressible
      sense&mdash;his sense of humor. He rather enjoyed seeing his own prejudice
      against women grotesquely reflected in this flighty stranger's prejudice
      against men. As the best excuse for himself that he could make, he gave
      her all the information that she could possibly want&mdash;then tried
      again to pass on&mdash;and again in vain. He had recovered his place in
      her estimation: she had not done with him yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know all about the way there," she said "I wonder whether you know
      anything about the school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No change in her voice, no change in her manner, betrayed any special
      motive for putting this question. Alban was on the point of suggesting
      that she should go on to the school, and make her inquiries there&mdash;when
      he happened to notice her eyes. She had hitherto looked him straight in
      the face. She now looked down on the road. It was a trifling change; in
      all probability it meant nothing&mdash;and yet, merely because it was a
      change, it roused his curiosity. "I ought to know something about the
      school," he answered. "I am one of the masters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you're just the man I want. May I ask your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alban Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. I am Mrs. Rook. I presume you have heard of Sir Jervis
      Redwood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my soul! You are a scholar, of course&mdash;and you have never
      heard of one of your own trade. Very extraordinary. You see, I am Sir
      Jervis's housekeeper; and I am sent here to take one of your young ladies
      back with me to our place. Don't interrupt me! Don't be a brute again! Sir
      Jervis is not of a communicative disposition. At least, not to me. A man&mdash;that
      explains it&mdash;a man! He is always poring over his books and writings;
      and Miss Redwood, at her great age, is in bed half the day. Not a thing do
      I know about this new inmate of ours, except that I am to take her back
      with me. You would feel some curiosity yourself in my place, wouldn't you?
      Now do tell me. What sort of girl is Miss Emily Brown?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The name that he was perpetually thinking of&mdash;on this woman's lips!
      Alban looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mrs. Rook, "am I to have no answer? Ah, you want leading. So
      like a man again! Is she pretty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still examining the housekeeper with mingled feelings of interest and
      distrust, Alban answered ungraciously:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-tempered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban again said "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much about herself," Mrs. Rook remarked. "About her family now?" She
      shifted her bag restlessly from one hand to another. "Perhaps you can tell
      me if Miss Emily's father&mdash;" she suddenly corrected herself&mdash;"if
      Miss Emily's parents are living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean you won't tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean exactly what I have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it doesn't matter," Mrs. Rook rejoined; "I shall find out at the
      school. The first turning to the left, I think you said&mdash;across the
      fields?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too deeply interested in Emily to let the housekeeper go without
      putting a question on his side:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Sir Jervis Redwood one of Miss Emily's old friends?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He? What put that into your head? He has never even seen Miss Emily.
      She's going to our house&mdash;ah, the women are getting the upper hand
      now, and serve the men right, I say!&mdash;she's going to our house to be
      Sir Jervis's secretary. You would like to have the place yourself,
      wouldn't you? You would like to keep a poor girl from getting her own
      living? Oh, you may look as fierce as you please&mdash;the time's gone by
      when a man could frighten <i>me</i>. I like her Christian name. I call
      Emily a nice name enough. But 'Brown'! Good-morning, Mr. Morris; you and I
      are not cursed with such a contemptibly common name as that! 'Brown'? Oh,
      Lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head scornfully, and walked away, humming a tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban stood rooted to the spot. The effort of his later life had been to
      conceal the hopeless passion which had mastered him in spite of himself.
      Knowing nothing from Emily&mdash;who at once pitied and avoided him&mdash;of
      her family circumstances or of her future plans, he had shrunk from making
      inquiries of others, in the fear that they, too, might find out his
      secret, and that their contempt might be added to the contempt which he
      felt for himself. In this position, and with these obstacles in his way,
      the announcement of Emily's proposed journey&mdash;under the care of a
      stranger, to fill an employment in the house of a stranger&mdash;not only
      took him by surprise, but inspired him with a strong feeling of distrust.
      He looked after Sir Jervis Redwood's flighty housekeeper, completely
      forgetting the purpose which had brought him thus far on the way to his
      lodgings. Before Mrs. Rook was out of sight, Alban Morris was following
      her back to the school.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. "COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE."
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss De Sor and Miss Wyvil were still sitting together under the trees,
      talking of the murder at the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that really all you can tell me?" said Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all," Cecilia answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no love in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None that I know of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the most uninteresting murder that ever was committed. What shall we
      do with ourselves? I'm tired of being here in the garden. When do the
      performances in the schoolroom begin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for two hours yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine yawned. "And what part do you take in it?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No part, my dear. I tried once&mdash;only to sing a simple little song.
      When I found myself standing before all the company and saw rows of ladies
      and gentlemen waiting for me to begin, I was so frightened that Miss Ladd
      had to make an apology for me. I didn't get over it for the rest of the
      day. For the first time in my life, I had no appetite for my dinner.
      Horrible!" said Cecilia, shuddering over the remembrance of it. "I do
      assure you, I thought I was going to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfectly unimpressed by this harrowing narrative, Francine turned her
      head lazily toward the house. The door was thrown open at the same moment.
      A lithe little person rapidly descended the steps that led to the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Emily come back again," said Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she seems to be rather in a hurry," Cecilia remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine's satirical smile showed itself for a moment. Did this appearance
      of hurry in Emily's movements denote impatience to resume the recital of
      "the dagger-scene"? She had no book in her hand; she never even looked
      toward Francine. Sorrow became plainly visible in her face as she
      approached the two girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia rose in alarm. She had been the first person to whom Emily had
      confided her domestic anxieties. "Bad news from your aunt?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear; no news at all." Emily put her arms tenderly round her
      friend's neck. "The time has come, Cecilia," she said. "We must wish each
      other good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mrs. Rook here already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's <i>you</i>, dear, who are going," Emily answered sadly. "They have
      sent the governess to fetch you. Miss Ladd is too busy in the schoolroom
      to see her&mdash;and she has told me all about it. Don't be alarmed. There
      is no bad news from home. Your plans are altered; that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Altered?" Cecilia repeated. "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a very agreeable way&mdash;you are going to travel. Your father wishes
      you to be in London, in time for the evening mail to France."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia guessed what had happened. "My sister is not getting well," she
      said, "and the doctors are sending her to the Continent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the baths at St. Moritz," Emily added. "There is only one difficulty
      in the way; and you can remove it. Your sister has the good old governess
      to take care of her, and the courier to relieve her of all trouble on the
      journey. They were to have started yesterday. You know how fond Julia is
      of you. At the last moment, she won't hear of going away, unless you go
      too. The rooms are waiting at St. Moritz; and your father is annoyed (the
      governess says) by the delay that has taken place already."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Cecilia was silent. "Surely you don't hesitate?" Emily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am too happy to go wherever Julia go es," Cecilia answered warmly; "I
      was thinking of you, dear." Her tender nature, shrinking from the hard
      necessities of life, shrank from the cruelly-close prospect of parting. "I
      thought we were to have had some hours together yet," she said. "Why are
      we hurried in this way? There is no second train to London, from our
      station, till late in the afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the express," Emily reminded her; "and there is time to catch
      it, if you drive at once to the town." She took Cecilia's hand and pressed
      it to her bosom. "Thank you again and again, dear, for all you have done
      for me. Whether we meet again or not, as long as I live I shall love you.
      Don't cry!" She made a faint attempt to resume her customary gayety, for
      Cecilia's sake. "Try to be as hard-hearted as I am. Think of your sister&mdash;don't
      think of me. Only kiss me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's tears fell fast. "Oh, my love, I am so anxious about you! I am
      so afraid that you will not be happy with that selfish old man&mdash;in
      that dreary house. Give it up, Emily! I have got plenty of money for both
      of us; come abroad with me. Why not? You always got on well with Julia,
      when you came to see us in the holidays. Oh, my darling! my darling! What
      shall I do without you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      All that longed for love in Emily's nature had clung round her
      school-friend since her father's death. Turning deadly pale under the
      struggle to control herself, she made the effort&mdash;and bore the pain
      of it without letting a cry or a tear escape her. "Our ways in life lie
      far apart," she said gently. "There is the hope of meeting again, dear&mdash;if
      there is nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clasp of Cecilia's arm tightened round her. She tried to release
      herself; but her resolution had reached its limits. Her hands dropped,
      trembling. She could still try to speak cheerfully, and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not the least reason, Cecilia, to be anxious about my prospects.
      I mean to be Sir Jervis Redwood's favorite before I have been a week in
      his service."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and pointed to the house. The governess was approaching them.
      "One more kiss, darling. We shall not forget the happy hours we have spent
      together; we shall constantly write to each other." She broke down at
      last. "Oh, Cecilia! Cecilia! leave me for God's sake&mdash;I can't bear it
      any longer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The governess parted them. Emily dropped into the chair that her friend
      had left. Even her hopeful nature sank under the burden of life at that
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hard voice, speaking close at her side, startled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you rather be Me," the voice asked, "without a creature to care for
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily raised her head. Francine, the unnoticed witness of the parting
      interview, was standing by her, idly picking the leaves from a rose which
      had dropped out of Cecilia's nosegay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she felt her own isolated position? She had felt it resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked at her, with a heart softened by sorrow. There was no
      answering kindness in the eyes of Miss de Sor&mdash;there was only a
      dogged endurance, sad to see in a creature so young.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and Cecilia are going to write to each other," she said. "I suppose
      there is some comfort in that. When I left the island they were glad to
      get rid of me. They said, 'Telegraph when you are safe at Miss Ladd's
      school.' You see, we are so rich, the expense of telegraphing to the West
      Indies is nothing to us. Besides, a telegram has an advantage over a
      letter&mdash;it doesn't take long to read. I daresay I shall write home.
      But they are in no hurry; and I am in no hurry. The school's breaking up;
      you are going your way, and I am going mine&mdash;and who cares what
      becomes of me? Only an ugly old schoolmistress, who is paid for caring. I
      wonder why I am saying all this? Because I like you? I don't know that I
      like you any better than you like me. When I wanted to be friends with
      you, you treated me coolly; I don't want to force myself on you. I don't
      particularly care about you. May I write to you from Brighton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Under all this bitterness&mdash;the first exhibition of Francine's temper,
      at its worst, which had taken place since she joined the school&mdash;Emily
      saw, or thought she saw, distress that was too proud, or too shy, to show
      itself. "How can you ask the question?" she answered cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was incapable of meeting the sympathy offered to her, even half
      way. "Never mind how," she said. "Yes or no is all I want from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Francine! Francine! what are you made of! Flesh and blood? or stone
      and iron? Write to me of course&mdash;and I will write back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. Are you going to stay here under the trees?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All by yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All by myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With nothing to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can think of Cecilia."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine eyed her with steady attention for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you tell me last night that you were very poor?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So poor that you are obliged to earn your own living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine looked at her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay you won't believe me," she said. "I wish I was you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away irritably, and walked back to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were there really longings for kindness and love under the surface of this
      girl's perverse nature? Or was there nothing to be hoped from a better
      knowledge of her?&mdash;In place of tender remembrances of Cecilia, these
      were the perplexing and unwelcome thoughts which the more potent
      personality of Francine forced upon Emily's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose impatiently, and looked at her watch. When would it be her turn
      to leave the school, and begin the new life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Still undecided what to do next, her interest was excited by the
      appearance of one of the servants on the lawn. The woman approached her,
      and presented a visiting-card; bearing on it the name of <i>Sir Jervis
      Redwood</i>. Beneath the name, there was a line written in pencil: "Mrs.
      Rook, to wait on Miss Emily Brown." The way to the new life was open
      before her at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking again at the commonplace announcement contained in the line of
      writing, she was not quite satisfied. Was it claiming a deference toward
      herself, to which she was not entitled, to expect a letter either from Sir
      Jervis, or from Miss Redwood; giving her some information as to the
      journey which she was about to undertake, and expressing with some little
      politeness the wish to make her comfortable in her future home? At any
      rate, her employer had done her one service: he had reminded her that her
      station in life was not what it had been in the days when her father was
      living, and when her aunt was in affluent circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up from the card. The servant had gone. Alban Morris was
      waiting at a little distance&mdash;waiting silently until she noticed him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. MASTER AND PUPIL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emily's impulse was to avoid the drawing-master for the second time. The
      moment afterward, a kinder feeling prevailed. The farewell interview with
      Cecilia had left influences which pleaded for Alban Morris. It was the day
      of parting good wishes and general separations: he had only perhaps come
      to say good-by. She advanced to offer her hand, when he stopped her by
      pointing to Sir Jervis Redwood's card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I say a word, Miss Emily, about that woman?" he asked
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean Mrs. Rook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You know, of course, why she comes here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She comes here by appointment, to take me to Sir Jervis Redwood's house.
      Are you acquainted with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a perfect stranger to me. I met her by accident on her way here.
      If Mrs. Rook had been content with asking me to direct her to the school,
      I should not be troubling you at this moment. But she forced her
      conversation on me. And she said something which I think you ought to
      know. Have you heard of Sir Jervis Redwood's housekeeper before to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have only heard what my friend&mdash;Miss Cecilia Wyvil&mdash;has told
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Miss Cecilia tell you that Mrs. Rook was acquainted with your father
      or with any members of your family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban reflected. "It was natural enough," he resumed, "that Mrs. Rook
      should feel some curiosity about You. What reason had she for putting a
      question to me about your father&mdash;and putting it in a very strange
      manner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's interest was instantly excited. She led the way back to the seats
      in the shade. "Tell me, Mr. Morris, exactly what the woman said." As she
      spoke, she signed to him to be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban observed the natural grace of her action when she set him the
      example of taking a chair, and the little heightening of her color caused
      by anxiety to hear what he had still to tell her. Forgetting the restraint
      that he had hitherto imposed on himself, he enjoyed the luxury of silently
      admiring her. Her manner betrayed none of the conscious confusion which
      would have shown itself, if her heart had been secretly inclined toward
      him. She saw the man looking at her. In simple perplexity she looked at
      the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you hesitating on my account?" she asked. "Did Mrs. Rook say
      something of my father which I mustn't hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! nothing of the sort!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to be confused."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her innocent indifference tried his patience sorely. His memory went back
      to the past time&mdash;recalled the ill-placed passion of his youth, and
      the cruel injury inflicted on him&mdash;his pride was roused. Was he
      making himself ridiculous? The vehement throbbing of his heart almost
      suffocated him. And there she sat, wondering at his odd behavior. "Even
      this girl is as cold-blooded as the rest of her sex!" That angry thought
      gave him back his self-control. He made his excuses with the easy
      politeness of a man of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Miss Emily; I was considering how to put what I have
      to say in the fewest and plainest words. Let me try if I can do it. If
      Mrs. Rook had merely asked me whether your father and mother were living,
      I should have attributed the question to the commonplace curiosity of a
      gossiping woman, and have thought no more of it. What she actually did say
      was this: 'Perhaps you can tell me if Miss Emily's father&mdash;' There
      she checked herself, and suddenly altered the question in this way: 'If
      Miss Emily's <i>parents</i> are living?' I may be making mountains out of
      molehills; but I thought at the time (and think still) that she had some
      special interest in inquiring after your father, and, not wishing me to
      notice it for reasons of her own, changed the form of the question so as
      to include your mother. Does this strike you as a far-fetched conclusion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever it may be," Emily said, "it is my conclusion, too. How did you
      answer her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite easily. I could give her no information&mdash;and I said so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me offer you the information, Mr. Morris, before we say anything
      more. I have lost both my parents."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's momentary outbreak of irritability was at an end. He was earnest
      and yet gentle, again; he forgave her for not understanding how dear and
      how delightful to him she was. "Will it distress you," he said, "if I ask
      how long it is since your father died?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly four years," she replied. "He was the most generous of men; Mrs.
      Rook's interest in him may surely have been a grateful interest. He may
      have been kind to her in past years&mdash;and she may remember him
      thankfully. Don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban was unable to agree with her. "If Mrs. Rook's interest in your
      father was the harmless interest that you have suggested," he said, "why
      should she have checked herself in that unaccountable manner, when she
      first asked me if he was living? The more I think of it now, the less sure
      I feel that she knows anything at all of your family history. It may help
      me to decide, if you will tell me at what time the death of your mother
      took place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long ago," Emily replied, "that I can't even remember her death. I was
      an infant at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet Mrs. Rook asked me if your 'parents' were living! One of two
      things," Alban concluded. "Either there is some mystery in this matter,
      which we cannot hope to penetrate at present&mdash;or Mrs. Rook may have
      been speaking at random; on the chance of discovering whether you are
      related to some 'Mr. Brown' whom she once knew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," Emily added, "it's only fair to remember what a common family
      name mine is, and how easily people may make mistakes. I should like to
      know if my dear lost father was really in her mind when she spoke to you.
      Do you think I could find it out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Mrs. Rook has any reasons for concealment, I believe you would have no
      chance of finding it out&mdash;unless, indeed, you could take her by
      surprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way, Mr. Morris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only one way occurs to me just now," he said. "Do you happen to have a
      miniature or a photograph of your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily held out a handsome locket, with a monogram in diamonds, attached to
      her watch chain. "I have his photograph here," she rejoined; "given to me
      by my dear old aunt, in the days of her prosperity. Shall I show it to
      Mrs. Rook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;if she happens, by good luck, to offer you an opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Impatient to try the experiment, Emily rose as he spoke. "I mustn't keep
      Mrs. Rook waiting," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban stopped her, on the point of leaving him. The confusion and
      hesitation which she had already noticed began to show themselves in his
      manner once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Emily, may I ask you a favor before you go? I am only one of the
      masters employed in the school; but I don't think&mdash;let me say, I hope
      I am not guilty of presumption&mdash;if I offer to be of some small
      service to one of my pupils&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There his embarrassment mastered him. He despised himself not only for
      yielding to his own weakness, but for faltering like a fool in the
      expression of a simple request. The next words died away on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, Emily understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subtle penetration which had long since led her to the discovery of
      his secret&mdash;overpowered, thus far, by the absorbing interest of the
      moment&mdash;now recovered its activity. In an instant, she remembered
      that Alban's motive for cautioning her, in her coming intercourse with
      Mrs. Rook, was not the merely friendly motive which might have actuated
      him, in the case of one of the other girls. At the same time, her
      quickness of apprehension warned her not to risk encouraging this
      persistent lover, by betraying any embarrassment on her side. He was
      evidently anxious to be present (in her interests) at the interview with
      Mrs. Rook. Why not? Could he reproach her with raising false hope, if she
      accepted his services, under circumstances of doubt and difficulty which
      he had himself been the first to point out? He could do nothing of the
      sort. Without waiting until he had recovered himself, she answered him (to
      all appearances) as composedly as if he had spoken to her in the plainest
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all that you have told me," she said, "I shall indeed feel obliged
      if you will be present when I see Mrs. Rook."
    </p>
    <p>
      The eager brightening of his eyes, the flush of happiness that made him
      look young on a sudden, were signs not to be mistaken. The sooner they
      were in the presence of a third person (Emily privately concluded) the
      better it might be for both of them. She led the way rapidly to the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. MRS. ROOK AND THE LOCKET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As mistress of a prosperous school, bearing a widely-extended reputation,
      Miss Ladd prided herself on the liberality of her household arrangements.
      At breakfast and dinner, not only the solid comforts but the elegant
      luxuries of the table, were set before the young ladies "Other schools
      may, and no doubt do, offer to pupils the affectionate care to which they
      have been accustomed under the parents' roof," Miss Ladd used to say. "At
      my school, that care extends to their meals, and provides them with a <i>cuisine</i>
      which, I flatter myself, equals the most successful efforts of the cooks
      at home." Fathers, mothers, and friends, when they paid visits to this
      excellent lady, brought away with them the most gratifying recollections
      of her hospitality. The men, in particular, seldom failed to recognize in
      their hostess the rarest virtue that a single lady can possess&mdash;the
      virtue of putting wine on the table which may be gratefully remembered by
      her guests the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      An agreeable surprise awaited Mrs. Rook when she entered the house of
      bountiful Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon was ready for Sir Jervis Redwood's confidential emissary in the
      waiting-room. Detained at the final rehearsals of music and recitation,
      Miss Ladd was worthily represented by cold chicken and ham, a fruit tart,
      and a pint decanter of generous sherry. "Your mistress is a perfect lady!"
      Mrs. Rook said to the servant, with a burst of enthusiasm. "I can carve
      for myself, thank you; and I don't care how long Miss Emily keeps me
      waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they ascended the steps leading into the house, Alban asked Emily if he
      might look again at her locket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I open it for you?" she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: I only want to look at the outside of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined the side on which the monogram appeared, inlaid with diamonds.
      An inscription was engraved beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I read it?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The inscription ran thus: "In loving memory of my father. Died 30th
      September, 1877."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you arrange the locket," Alban asked, "so that the side on which the
      diamonds appear hangs outward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood him. The diamonds might attract Mrs. Rook's notice; and in
      that case, she might ask to see the locket of her own accord. "You are
      beginning to be of use to me, already," Emily said, as they turned into
      the corridor which led to the waiting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Sir Jervis's housekeeper luxuriously recumbent in the easiest
      chair in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the eatable part of the lunch some relics were yet left. In the pint
      decanter of sherry, not a drop remained. The genial influence of the wine
      (hastened by the hot weather) was visible in Mrs. Rook's flushed face, and
      in a special development of her ugly smile. Her widening lips stretched to
      new lengths; and the white upper line of her eyeballs were more freely and
      horribly visible than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is the dear young lady?" she said, lifting her hands in
      over-acted admiration. At the first greetings, Alban perceived that the
      impression produced was, in Emily's case as in his case, instantly
      unfavorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant came in to clear the table. Emily stepped aside for a minute
      to give some directions about her luggage. In that interval Mrs. Rook's
      cunning little eyes turned on Alban with an expression of malicious
      scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were walking the other way," she whispered, "when I met you." She
      stopped, and glanced over her shoulder at Emily. "I see what attraction
      has brought you back to the school. Steal your way into that poor little
      fool's heart; and then make her miserable for the rest of her life!&mdash;No
      need, miss, to hurry," she said, shifting the polite side of her toward
      Emily, who returned at the moment. "The visits of the trains to your
      station here are like the visits of the angels described by the poet, 'few
      and far between.' Please excuse the quotation. You wouldn't think it to
      look at me&mdash;I'm a great reader."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a long journey to Sir Jervis Redwood's house?" Emily asked, at a
      loss what else to say to a woman who was already becoming unendurable to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook looked at the journey from an oppressively cheerful point of
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Emily, you shan't feel the time hang heavy in my company. I can
      converse on a variety of topics, and if there is one thing more than
      another that I like, it's amusing a pretty young lady. You think me a
      strange creature, don't you? It's only my high spirits. Nothing strange
      about me&mdash;unless it's my queer Christian name. You look a little
      dull, my dear. Shall I begin amusing you before we are on the railway?
      Shall I tell you how I came by my queer name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Alban had controlled himself. This last specimen of the
      housekeeper's audacious familiarity reached the limits of his endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't care to know how you came by your name," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rude," Mrs. Rook remarked, composedly. "But nothing surprises me, coming
      from a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Emily. "My father and mother were a wicked married couple,"
      she continued, "before I was born. They 'got religion,' as the saying is,
      at a Methodist meeting in a field. When I came into the world&mdash;I
      don't know how you feel, miss; I protest against being brought into the
      world without asking my leave first&mdash;my mother was determined to
      dedicate me to piety, before I was out of my long clothes. What name do
      you suppose she had me christened by? She chose it, or made it, herself&mdash;the
      name of 'Righteous'! Righteous Rook! Was there ever a poor baby degraded
      by such a ridiculous name before? It's needless to say, when I write
      letters, I sign R. Rook&mdash;and leave people to think it's Rosamond, or
      Rosabelle, or something sweetly pretty of that kind. You should have seen
      my husband's face when he first heard that his sweetheart's name was
      'Righteous'! He was on the point of kissing me, and he stopped. I daresay
      he felt sick. Perfectly natural under the circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban tried to stop her again. "What time does the train go?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily entreated him to restrain himself, by a look. Mrs. Rook was still
      too inveterately amiable to take offense. She opened her traveling-bag
      briskly, and placed a railway guide in Alban's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard that the women do the men's work in foreign parts," she said.
      "But this is England; and I am an Englishwoman. Find out when the train
      goes, my dear sir, for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban at once consulted the guide. If there proved to be no immediate need
      of starting for the station, he was determined that Emily should not be
      condemned to pass the interval in the housekeeper's company. In the
      meantime, Mrs. Rook was as eager as ever to show her dear young lady what
      an amusing companion she could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talking of husbands," she resumed, "don't make the mistake, my dear, that
      I committed. Beware of letting anybody persuade you to marry an old man.
      Mr. Rook is old enough to be my father. I bear with him. Of course, I bear
      with him. At the same time, I have not (as the poet says) 'passed through
      the ordeal unscathed.' My spirit&mdash;I have long since ceased to believe
      in anything of the sort: I only use the word for want of a better&mdash;my
      spirit, I say, has become embittered. I was once a pious young woman; I do
      assure you I was nearly as good as my name. Don't let me shock you; I have
      lost faith and hope; I have become&mdash;what's the last new name for a
      free-thinker? Oh, I keep up with the times, thanks to old Miss Redwood!
      She takes in the newspapers, and makes me read them to her. What <i>is</i>
      the new name? Something ending in ic. Bombastic? No, Agnostic?&mdash;that's
      it! I have become an Agnostic. The inevitable result of marrying an old
      man; if there's any blame it rests on my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's more than an hour yet before the train starts," Alban interposed.
      "I am sure, Miss Emily, you would find it pleasanter to wait in the
      garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all a bad notion," Mrs. Rook declared. "Here's a man who can make
      himself useful, for once. Let's go into the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and led the way to the door. Alban seized the opportunity of
      whispering to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you notice the empty decanter, when we first came in? That horrid
      woman is drunk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily pointed significantly to the locket. "Don't let her go. The garden
      will distract her attention: keep her near me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook gayly opened the door. "Take me to the flower-beds," she said.
      "I believe in nothing&mdash;but I adore flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook waited at the door, with her eye on Emily. "What do <i>you</i>
      say, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we shall be more comfortable if we stay where we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever pleases you, my dear, pleases me." With this reply, the
      compliant housekeeper&mdash;as amiable as ever on the surface&mdash;returned
      to her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would she notice the locket as she sat down? Emily turned toward the
      window, so as to let the light fall on the diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      No: Mrs. Rook was absorbed, at the moment, in her own reflections. Miss
      Emily, having prevented her from seeing the garden, she was maliciously
      bent on disappointing Miss Emily in return. Sir Jervis's secretary (being
      young) took a hopeful view no doubt of her future prospects. Mrs. Rook
      decided on darkening that view in a mischievously-suggestive manner,
      peculiar to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will naturally feel some curiosity about your new home," she began,
      "and I haven't said a word about it yet. How very thoughtless of me!
      Inside and out, dear Miss Emily, our house is just a little dull. I say <i>our</i>
      house, and why not&mdash;when the management of it is all thrown on me. We
      are built of stone; and we are much too long, and are not half high
      enough. Our situation is on the coldest side of the county, away in the
      west. We are close to the Cheviot hills; and if you fancy there is
      anything to see when you look out of window, except sheep, you will find
      yourself woefully mistaken. As for walks, if you go out on one side of the
      house you may, or may not, be gored by cattle. On the other side, if the
      darkness overtakes you, you may, or may not, tumble down a deserted lead
      mine. But the company, inside the house, makes amends for it all," Mrs.
      Rook proceeded, enjoying the expression of dismay which was beginning to
      show itself on Emily's face. "Plenty of excitement for you, my dear, in
      our small family. Sir Jervis will introduce you to plaster casts of
      hideous Indian idols; he will keep you writing for him, without mercy,
      from morning to night; and when he does let you go, old Miss Redwood will
      find she can't sleep, and will send for the pretty young lady-secretary to
      read to her. My husband I am sure you will like. He is a respectable man,
      and bears the highest character. Next to the idols, he's the most hideous
      object in the house. If you are good enough to encourage him, I don't say
      that he won't amuse you; he will tell you, for instance, he never in his
      life hated any human being as he hates his wife. By the way, I must not
      forget&mdash;in the interests of truth, you know&mdash;to mention one
      drawback that does exist in our domestic circle. One of these days we
      shall have our brains blown out or our throats cut. Sir Jervis's mother
      left him ten thousand pounds' worth of precious stones all contained in a
      little cabinet with drawers. He won't let the banker take care of his
      jewels; he won't sell them; he won't even wear one of the rings on his
      finger, or one of the pins at his breast. He keeps his cabinet on his
      dressing-room table; and he says, 'I like to gloat over my jewels, every
      night, before I go to bed.' Ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds,
      rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and what not&mdash;at the mercy of the first
      robber who happens to hear of them. Oh, my dear, he would have no choice,
      I do assure you, but to use his pistols. We shouldn't quietly submit to be
      robbed. Sir Jervis inherits the spirit of his ancestors. My husband has
      the temper of a game cock. I myself, in defense of the property of my
      employers, am capable of becoming a perfect fiend. And we none of us
      understand the use of firearms!"
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was in full enjoyment of this last aggravation of the horrors of
      the prospect, Emily tried another change of position&mdash;and, this time,
      with success. Greedy admiration suddenly opened Mrs. Rook's little eyes to
      their utmost width. "My heart alive, miss, what do I see at your
      watch-chain? How they sparkle! Might I ask for a closer view?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's fingers trembled; but she succeeded in detaching the locket from
      the chain. Alban handed it to Mrs. Rook.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began by admiring the diamonds&mdash;with a certain reserve. "Nothing
      like so large as Sir Jervis's diamonds; but choice specimens no doubt.
      Might I ask what the value&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped. The inscription had attracted her notice: she began to read
      it aloud: "In loving memory of my father. Died&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face instantly became rigid. The next words were suspended on her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban seized the chance of making her betray herself&mdash;under pretense
      of helping her. "Perhaps you find the figures not easy to read," he said.
      "The date is 'thirtieth September, eighteen hundred and seventy-seven'&mdash;nearly
      four years since."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word, not a movement, escaped Mrs. Rook. She held the locket before
      her as she had held it from the first. Alban looked at Emily. Her eyes
      were riveted on the housekeeper: she was barely capable of preserving the
      appearance of composure. Seeing the necessity of acting for her, he at
      once said the words which she was unable to say for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, Mrs. Rook, you would like to look at the portrait?" he
      suggested. "Shall I open the locket for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without speaking, without looking up, she handed the locket to Alban.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened it, and offered it to her. She neither accepted nor refused it:
      her hands remained hanging over the arms of the chair. He put the locket
      on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait produced no marked effect on Mrs. Rook. Had the date prepared
      her to see it? She sat looking at it&mdash;still without moving: still
      without saying a word. Alban had no mercy on her. "That is the portrait of
      Miss Emily's father," he said. "Does it represent the same Mr. Brown whom
      you had in your mind when you asked me if Miss Emily's father was still
      living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That question roused her. She looked up, on the instant; she answered
      loudly and insolently: "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," Alban persisted, "you broke down in reading the inscription:
      and considering what talkative woman you are, the portrait has had a
      strange effect on you&mdash;to say the least of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She eyed him steadily while he was speaking&mdash;and turned to Emily when
      he had done. "You mentioned the heat just now, miss. The heat has overcome
      me; I shall soon get right again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The insolent futility of that excuse irritated Emily into answering her.
      "You will get right again perhaps all the sooner," she said, "if we
      trouble you with no more questions, and leave you to recover by yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The first change of expression which relaxed the iron tensity of the
      housekeeper's face showed itself when she heard that reply. At last there
      was a feeling in Mrs. Rook which openly declared itself&mdash;a feeling of
      impatience to see Alban and Emily leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left her, without a word more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. GUESSES AT THE TRUTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "What are we to do next? Oh, Mr. Morris, you must have seen all sorts of
      people in your time&mdash;you know human nature, and I don't. Help me with
      a word of advice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily forgot that he was in love with her&mdash;forgot everything, but the
      effect produced by the locket on Mrs. Rook, and the vaguely alarming
      conclusion to which it pointed. In the fervor of her anxiety she took
      Alban's arm as familiarly as if he had been her brother. He was gentle, he
      was considerate; he tried earnestly to compose her. "We can do nothing to
      any good purpose," he said, "unless we begin by thinking quietly. Pardon
      me for saying so&mdash;you are needlessly exciting yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a reason for her excitement, of which he was necessarily
      ignorant. Her memory of the night interview with Miss Jethro had
      inevitably intensified the suspicion inspired by the conduct of Mrs. Rook.
      In less than twenty-four hours, Emily had seen two women shrinking from
      secret remembrances of her father&mdash;which might well be guilty
      remembrances&mdash;innocently excited by herself! How had they injured
      him? Of what infamy, on their parts, did his beloved and stainless memory
      remind them? Who could fathom the mystery of it? "What does it mean?" she
      cried, looking wildly in Alban's compassionate face. "You <i>must</i> have
      formed some idea of your own. What does it mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, and sit down, Miss Emily. We will try if we can find out what it
      means, together."
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the shady solitude under the trees. Away, in front of the
      house, the distant grating of carriage wheels told of the arrival of Miss
      Ladd's guests, and of the speedy beginning of the ceremonies of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must help each other," Alban resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we first spoke of Mrs. Rook, you mentioned Miss Cecilia Wyvil as a
      person who knew something about her. Have you any objection to tell me
      what you may have heard in that way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In complying with his request Emily necessarily repeated what Cecilia had
      told Francine, when the two girls had met that morning in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban now knew how Emily had obtained employment as Sir Jervis's
      secretary; how Mr. and Mrs. Rook had been previously known to Cecilia's
      father as respectable people keeping an inn in his own neighborhood; and,
      finally, how they had been obliged to begin life again in domestic
      service, because the terrible event of a murder had given the inn a bad
      name, and had driven away the customers on whose encouragement their
      business depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening in silence, Alban remained silent when Emily's narrative had
      come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you nothing to say to me?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thinking over what I have just heard," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily noticed a certain formality in his tone and manner, which
      disagreeably surprised her. He seemed to have made his reply as a mere
      concession to politeness, while he was thinking of something else which
      really interested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I disappointed you in any way?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, you have interested me. I want to be quite sure that I
      remember exactly what you have said. You mentioned, I think, that your
      friendship with Miss Cecilia Wyvil began here, at the school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in speaking of the murder at the village inn, you told me that the
      crime was committed&mdash;I have forgotten how long ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner still suggested that he was idly talking about what she had
      told him, while some more important subject for reflection was in
      possession of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that I said anything about the time that had passed since
      the crime was committed," she answered, sharply. "What does the murder
      matter to <i>us?</i> I think Cecilia told me it happened about four years
      since. Excuse me for noticing it, Mr. Morris&mdash;you seem to have some
      interests of your own to occupy your attention. Why couldn't you say so
      plainly when we came out here? I should not have asked you to help me, in
      that case. Since my poor father's death, I have been used to fight through
      my troubles by myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and looked at him proudly. The next moment her eyes filled with
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her resistance, Alban took her hand. "Dear Miss Emily," he
      said, "you distress me: you have not done me justice. Your interests only
      are in my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering her in those terms, he had not spoken as frankly as usual. He
      had only told her a part of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that the woman whom they had just left had been landlady of an
      inn, and that a murder had been committed under her roof, he was led to
      ask himself if any explanation might be found, in these circumstances, of
      the otherwise incomprehensible effect produced on Mrs. Rook by the
      inscription on the locket.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pursuit of this inquiry there had arisen in his mind a monstrous
      suspicion, which pointed to Mrs. Rook. It impelled him to ascertain the
      date at which the murder had been committed, and (if the discovery
      encouraged further investigation) to find out next the manner in which Mr.
      Brown had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, what progress had he made? He had discovered that the date of
      Mr. Brown's death, inscribed on the locket, and the date of the crime
      committed at the inn, approached each other nearly enough to justify
      further investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, had he succeeded in keeping his object concealed from
      Emily? He had perfectly succeeded. Hearing him declare that her interests
      only had occupied his mind, the poor girl innocently entreated him to
      forgive her little outbreak of temper. "If you have any more questions to
      ask me, Mr. Morris, pray go on. I promise never to think unjustly of you
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on with an uneasy conscience&mdash;for it seemed cruel to deceive
      her, even in the interests of truth&mdash;but still he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose we assume that this woman had injured your father in some way,"
      he said. "Am I right in believing that it was in his character to forgive
      injuries?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, his death may have left Mrs. Rook in a position to be
      called to account, by those who owe a duty to his memory&mdash;I mean the
      surviving members of his family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are but two of us, Mr. Morris. My aunt and myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are his executors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My aunt is his only executor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father's sister&mdash;I presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may have left instructions with her, which might be of the greatest
      use to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will write to-day, and find out," Emily replied. "I had already planned
      to consult my aunt," she added, thinking again of Miss Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your aunt has not received any positive instructions," Alban
      continued, "she may remember some allusion to Mrs. Rook, on your father's
      part, at the time of his last illness&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stopped him. "You don't know how my dear father died," she said. "He
      was struck down&mdash;apparently in perfect health&mdash;by disease of the
      heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Struck down in his own house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;in his own house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words closed Alban's lips. The investigation so carefully and so
      delicately conducted had failed to serve any useful purpose. He had now
      ascertained the manner of Mr. Brown's death and the place of Mr. Brown's
      death&mdash;and he was as far from confirming his suspicions of Mrs. Rook
      as ever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE DRAWING-MASTER'S CONFESSION.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "Is there nothing else you can suggest?" Emily asked.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Nothing&mdash;at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my aunt fails us, have we no other hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have hope in Mrs. Rook," Alban answered. "I see I surprise you; but I
      really mean what I say. Sir Jervis's housekeeper is an excitable woman,
      and she is fond of wine. There is always a weak side in the character of
      such a person as that. If we wait for our chance, and turn it to the right
      use when it comes, we may yet succeed in making her betray herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily listened to him in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You talk as if I was sure of your help in the future," she said. "Have
      you forgotten that I leave school to-day, never to return? In half an hour
      more, I shall be condemned to a long journey in the company of that
      horrible creature&mdash;with a life to look forward to, in the same house
      with her, among strangers! A miserable prospect, and a hard trial of a
      girl's courage&mdash;is it not, Mr. Morris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will at least have one person, Miss Emily, who will try with all his
      heart and soul to encourage you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean," said Alban, quietly, "that the Midsummer vacation begins to-day;
      and that the drawing-master is going to spend his holidays in the North."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily jumped up from her chair. "You!" she exclaimed. "<i>You</i> are
      going to Northumberland? With me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" Alban asked. "The railway is open to all travelers alike, if
      they have money enough to buy a ticket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Morris! what <i>can</i> you be thinking of? Indeed, indeed, I am not
      ungrateful. I know you mean kindly&mdash;you are a good, generous man. But
      do remember how completely a girl, in my position, is at the mercy of
      appearances. You, traveling in the same carriage with me! and that woman
      putting her own vile interpretation on it, and degrading me in Sir Jervis
      Redwood's estimation, on the day when I enter his house! Oh, it's worse
      than thoughtless&mdash;it's madness, downright madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right," Alban gravely agreed, "it <i>is</i> madness. I lost
      whatever little reason I once possessed, Miss Emily, on the day when I
      first met you out walking with the young ladies of the school."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily turned away in significant silence. Alban followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promised just now," he said, "never to think unjustly of me again. I
      respect and admire you far too sincerely to take a base advantage of this
      occasion&mdash;the only occasion on which I have been permitted to speak
      with you alone. Wait a little before you condemn a man whom you don't
      understand. I will say nothing to annoy you&mdash;I only ask leave to
      explain myself. Will you take your chair again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned unwillingly to her seat. "It can only end," she thought,
      sadly, "in my disappointing him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had the worst possible opinion of women for years past," Alban
      resumed; "and the only reason I can give for it condemns me out of my own
      mouth. I have been infamously treated by one woman; and my wounded
      self-esteem has meanly revenged itself by reviling the whole sex. Wait a
      little, Miss Emily. My fault has received its fit punishment. I have been
      thoroughly humiliated&mdash;and <i>you</i> have done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Morris!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take no offense, pray, where no offense is meant. Some few years since it
      was the great misfortune of my life to meet with a Jilt. You know what I
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was my equal by birth (I am a younger son of a country squire), and
      my superior in rank. I can honestly tell you that I was fool enough to
      love her with all my heart and soul. She never allowed me to doubt&mdash;I
      may say this without conceit, remembering the miserable end of it&mdash;that
      my feeling for her was returned. Her father and mother (excellent people)
      approved of the contemplated marriage. She accepted my presents; she
      allowed all the customary preparations for a wedding to proceed to
      completion; she had not even mercy en ough, or shame enough, to prevent me
      from publicly degrading myself by waiting for her at the altar, in the
      presence of a large congregation. The minutes passed&mdash;and no bride
      appeared. The clergyman, waiting like me, was requested to return to the
      vestry. I was invited to follow him. You foresee the end of the story, of
      course? She had run away with another man. But can you guess who the man
      was? Her groom!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's face reddened with indignation. "She suffered for it? Oh, Mr.
      Morris, surely she suffered for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. She had money enough to reward the groom for marrying her;
      and she let herself down easily to her husband's level. It was a suitable
      marriage in every respect. When I last heard of them, they were regularly
      in the habit of getting drunk together. I am afraid I have disgusted you?
      We will drop the subject, and resume my precious autobiography at a later
      date. One showery day in the autumn of last year, you young ladies went
      out with Miss Ladd for a walk. When you were all trotting back again,
      under your umbrellas, did you (in particular) notice an ill-tempered
      fellow standing in the road, and getting a good look at you, on the high
      footpath above him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily smiled, in spite of herself. "I don't remember it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wore a brown jacket which fitted you as if you had been born in it&mdash;and
      you had the smartest little straw hat I ever saw on a woman's head. It was
      the first time I ever noticed such things. I think I could paint a
      portrait of the boots you wore (mud included), from memory alone. That was
      the impression you produced on me. After believing, honestly believing,
      that love was one of the lost illusions of my life&mdash;after feeling,
      honestly feeling, that I would as soon look at the devil as look at a
      woman&mdash;there was the state of mind to which retribution had reduced
      me; using for his instrument Miss Emily Brown. Oh, don't be afraid of what
      I may say next! In your presence, and out of your presence, I am man
      enough to be ashamed of my own folly. I am resisting your influence over
      me at this moment, with the strongest of all resolutions&mdash;the
      resolution of despair. Let's look at the humorous side of the story again.
      What do you think I did when the regiment of young ladies had passed by
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily declined to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I followed you back to the school; and, on pretense of having a daughter
      to educate, I got one of Miss Ladd's prospectuses from the porter at the
      lodge gate. I was in your neighborhood, you must know, on a sketching
      tour. I went back to my inn, and seriously considered what had happened to
      me. The result of my cogitations was that I went abroad. Only for a change&mdash;not
      at all because I was trying to weaken the impression you had produced on
      me! After a while I returned to England. Only because I was tired of
      traveling&mdash;not at all because your influence drew me back! Another
      interval passed; and luck turned my way, for a wonder. The
      drawing-master's place became vacant here. Miss Ladd advertised; I
      produced my testimonials; and took the situation. Only because the salary
      was a welcome certainty to a poor man&mdash;not at all because the new
      position brought me into personal association with Miss Emily Brown! Do
      you begin to see why I have troubled you with all this talk about myself?
      Apply the contemptible system of self-delusion which my confession has
      revealed, to that holiday arrangement for a tour in the north which has
      astonished and annoyed you. I am going to travel this afternoon by your
      train. Only because I feel an intelligent longing to see the northernmost
      county of England&mdash;not at all because I won't let you trust yourself
      alone with Mrs. Rook! Not at all because I won't leave you to enter Sir
      Jervis Redwood's service without a friend within reach in case you want
      him! Mad? Oh, yes&mdash;perfectly mad. But, tell me this: What do all
      sensible people do when they find themselves in the company of a lunatic?
      They humor him. Let me take your ticket and see your luggage labeled: I
      only ask leave to be your traveling servant. If you are proud&mdash;I
      shall like you all the better, if you are&mdash;pay me wages, and keep me
      in my proper place in that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some girls, addressed with this reckless intermingling of jest and
      earnest, would have felt confused, and some would have felt flattered.
      With a good-tempered resolution, which never passed the limits of modesty
      and refinement, Emily met Alban Morris on his own ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have said you respect me," she began; "I am going to prove that I
      believe you. The least I can do is not to misinterpret you, on my side. Am
      I to understand, Mr. Morris&mdash;you won't think the worse of me, I hope,
      if I speak plainly&mdash;am I to understand that you are in love with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Miss Emily&mdash;if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had answered with the quaint gravity which was peculiar to him; but he
      was already conscious of a sense of discouragement. Her composure was a
      bad sign&mdash;from his point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My time will come, I daresay," she proceeded. "At present I know nothing
      of love, by experience; I only know what some of my schoolfellows talk
      about in secret. Judging by what they tell me, a girl blushes when her
      lover pleads with her to favor his addresses. Am I blushing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I speak plainly, too?" Alban asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you have no objection," she answered, as composedly as if she had been
      addressing her grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Miss Emily, I must say&mdash;you are not blushing."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on. "Another token of love&mdash;as I am informed&mdash;is to
      tremble. Am I trembling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I too confused to look at you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I walk away with dignity&mdash;and then stop, and steal a timid glance
      at my lover, over my shoulder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you did!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A plain answer, Mr. Morris! Yes or No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one last word, do I give you any sort of encouragement to try again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one last word, I have made a fool of myself&mdash;and you have taken
      the kindest possible way of telling me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, she made no attempt to reply in his own tone. The good-humored
      gayety of her manner disappeared. She was in earnest&mdash;truly, sadly in
      earnest&mdash;when she said her next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not best, in your own interests, that we should bid each other
      good-by?" she asked. "In the time to come&mdash;when you only remember how
      kind you once were to me&mdash;we may look forward to meeting again. After
      all that you have suffered, so bitterly and so undeservedly, don't, pray
      don't, make me feel that another woman has behaved cruelly to you, and
      that I&mdash;so grieved to distress you&mdash;am that heartless creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in her life had she been so irresistibly charming as she was at that
      moment. Her sweet nature showed all its innocent pity for him in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw it&mdash;he felt it&mdash;he was not unworthy of it. In silence, he
      lifted her hand to his lips. He turned pale as he kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say that you agree with me?" she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I obey you."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he answered, he pointed to the lawn at their feet. "Look," he said, "at
      that dead leaf which the air is wafting over the grass. Is it possible
      that such sympathy as you feel for Me, such love as I feel for You, can
      waste, wither, and fall to the ground like that leaf? I leave you, Emily&mdash;with
      the firm conviction that there is a time of fulfillment to come in our two
      lives. Happen what may in the interval&mdash;I trust the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words had barely passed his lips when the voice of one of the servants
      reached them from the house. "Miss Emily, are you in the garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stepped out into the sunshine. The servant hurried to meet her, and
      placed a telegram in her hand. She looked at it with a sudden misgiving.
      In her small experience, a telegram was associated with the communication
      of bad news. She conquered her hesitation&mdash;opened it&mdash;read it.
      The color left her face: she shuddered. The telegram dropped on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read it," she said, faintly, as Alban picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read these words: "Come to London directly. Miss Letitia is dangerously
      ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your aunt?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;my aunt."

      CHAPTER XII. MRS. ELLMOTHER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The metropolis of Great Britain is, in certain respects, like no other
      metropolis on the face of the earth. In the population that throngs the
      streets, the extremes of Wealth and the extremes of Poverty meet, as they
      meet nowhere else. In the streets themselves, the glory and the shame of
      architecture&mdash;the mansion and the hovel&mdash;are neighbors in
      situation, as they are neighbors nowhere else. London, in its social
      aspect, is the city of contrasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of evening Emily left the railway terminus for the place
      of residence in which loss of fortune had compelled her aunt to take
      refuge. As she approached her destination, the cab passed&mdash;by merely
      crossing a road&mdash;from a spacious and beautiful Park, with its
      surrounding houses topped by statues and cupolas, to a row of cottages,
      hard by a stinking ditch miscalled a canal. The city of contrasts: north
      and south, east and west, the city of social contrasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stopped the cab before the garden gate of a cottage, at the further
      end of the row. The bell was answered by the one servant now in her aunt's
      employ&mdash;Miss Letitia's maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, this good creature was one of the ill-fated women whose
      appearance suggests that Nature intended to make men of them and altered
      her mind at the last moment. Miss Letitia's maid was tall and gaunt and
      awkward. The first impression produced by her face was an impression of
      bones. They rose high on her forehead; they projected on her cheeks; and
      they reached their boldest development in her jaws. In the cavernous eyes
      of this unfortunate person rigid obstinacy and rigid goodness looked out
      together, with equal severity, on all her fellow-creatures alike. Her
      mistress (whom she had served for a quarter of a century and more) called
      her "Bony." She accepted this cruelly appropriate nick-name as a mark of
      affectionate familiarity which honored a servant. No other person was
      allowed to take liberties with her: to every one but her mistress she was
      known as Mrs. Ellmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is my aunt?" Emily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have I not heard of her illness before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because she's too fond of you to let you be distressed about her. 'Don't
      tell Emily'; those were her orders, as long as she kept her senses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kept her senses? Good heavens! what do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fever&mdash;that's what I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must see her directly; I am not afraid of infection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no infection to be afraid of. But you mustn't see her, for all
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I insist on seeing her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Emily, I am disappointing you for your own good. Don't you know me
      well enough to trust me by this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then leave my mistress to me&mdash;and go and make yourself comfortable
      in your own room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's answer was a positive refusal. Mrs. Ellmother, driven to her last
      resources, raised a new obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not to be done, I tell you! How can you see Miss Letitia when she
      can't bear the light in her room? Do you know what color her eyes are?
      Red, poor soul&mdash;red as a boiled lobster."
    </p>
    <p>
      With every word the woman uttered, Emily's perplexity and distress
      increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told me my aunt's illness was fever," she said&mdash;"and now you
      speak of some complaint in her eyes. Stand out of the way, if you please,
      and let me go to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother, still keeping her place, looked through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's the doctor," she announced. "It seems I can't satisfy you; ask him
      what's the matter. Come in, doctor." She threw open the door of the
      parlor, and introduced Emily. "This is the mistress's niece, sir. Please
      try if <i>you</i> can keep her quiet. I can't." She placed chairs with the
      hospitable politeness of the old school&mdash;and returned to her post at
      Miss Letitia's bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday was an elderly man, with a cool manner and a ruddy
      complexion&mdash;thoroughly acclimatized to the atmosphere of pain and
      grief in which it was his destiny to live. He spoke to Emily (without any
      undue familiarity) as if he had been accustomed to see her for the greater
      part of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a curious woman," he said, when Mrs. Ellmother closed the door;
      "the most headstrong person, I think, I ever met with. But devoted to her
      mistress, and, making allowance for her awkwardness, not a bad nurse. I am
      afraid I can't give you an encouraging report of your aunt. The rheumatic
      fever (aggravated by the situation of this house&mdash;built on clay, you
      know, and close to stagnant water) has been latterly complicated by
      delirium."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that a bad sign, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The worst possible sign; it shows that the disease has affected the
      heart. Yes: she is suffering from inflammation of the eyes, but that is an
      unimportant symptom. We can keep the pain under by means of cooling
      lotions and a dark room. I've often heard her speak of you&mdash;especially
      since the illness assumed a serious character. What did you say? Will she
      know you, when you go into her room? This is about the time when the
      delirium usually sets in. I'll see if there's a quiet interval."
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door&mdash;and came back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," he resumed, "I ought perhaps to explain how it was that I
      took the liberty of sending you that telegram. Mrs. Ellmother refused to
      inform you of her mistress's serious illness. That circumstance, according
      to my view of it, laid the responsibility on the doctor's shoulders. The
      form taken by your aunt's delirium&mdash;I mean the apparent tendency of
      the words that escape her in that state&mdash;seems to excite some
      incomprehensible feeling in the mind of her crabbed servant. She wouldn't
      even let <i>me</i> go into the bedroom, if she could possibly help it. Did
      Mrs. Ellmother give you a warm welcome when you came here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it. My arrival seemed to annoy her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;just what I expected. These faithful old servants always end by
      presuming on their fidelity. Did you ever hear what a witty poet&mdash;I
      forget his name: he lived to be ninety&mdash;said of the man who had been
      his valet for more than half a century? 'For thirty years he was the best
      of servants; and for thirty years he has been the hardest of masters.'
      Quite true&mdash;I might say the same of my housekeeper. Rather a good
      story, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was completely thrown away on Emily; but one subject interested
      her now. "My poor aunt has always been fond of me," she said. "Perhaps she
      might know me, when she recognizes nobody else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very likely," the doctor answered. "But there's no laying down any
      rule in cases of this kind. I have sometimes observed that circumstances
      which have produced a strong impression on patients, when they are in a
      state of health, give a certain direction to the wandering of their minds,
      when they are in a state of fever. You will say, 'I am not a circumstance;
      I don't see how this encourages me to hope'&mdash;and you will be quite
      right. Instead of talking of my medical experience, I shall do better to
      look at Miss Letitia, and let you know the result. You have got other
      relations, I suppose? No? Very distressing&mdash;very distressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Who has not suffered as Emily suffered, when she was left alone? Are there
      not moments&mdash;if we dare to confess the truth&mdash;when poor humanity
      loses its hold on the consolations of religion and the hope of
      immortality, and feels the cruelty of creation that bids us live, on the
      condition that we die, and leads the first warm beginnings of love, with
      merciless certainty, to the cold conclusion of the grave?
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's quiet, for the time being," Dr. Allday announced, on his return.
      "Remember, please, that she can't see you in the inflamed state of her
      eyes, and don't disturb the bed-curtains. The sooner you go to her the
      better, perhaps&mdash;if you have anything to say which depends on her
      recognizing your voice. I'll call to-morrow morning. Very distressing," he
      repeated, taking his hat and making his bow&mdash;"Very distressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily crossed the narrow little passage which separated the two rooms, and
      opened the bed-chamber door. Mrs. Ellmother met her on the threshold.
      "No," said the obstinate old servant, "you can't come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint voice of Miss Letitia made itself heard, calling Mrs. Ellmother
      by her familiar nick-name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bony, who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Emily, if you must know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! poor dear, why does she come here? Who told her I was ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor told her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't come in, Emily. It will only distress you&mdash;and it will do me
      no good. God bless you, my love. Don't come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" said Mrs. Ellmother. "Do you hear that? Go back to the
      sitting-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, the hard necessity of controlling herself had kept Emily silent.
      She was now able to speak without tears. "Remember the old times, aunt,"
      she pleaded, gently. "Don't keep me out of your room, when I have come
      here to nurse you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm her nurse. Go back to the sitting-room," Mrs. Ellmother repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      True love lasts while life lasts. The dying woman relented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bony! Bony! I can't be unkind to Emily. Let her in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother still insisted on having her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're contradicting your own orders," she said to her mistress. "You
      don't know how soon you may begin wandering in your mind again. Think,
      Miss Letitia&mdash;think."
    </p>
    <p>
      This remonstrance was received in silence. Mrs. Ellmother's great gaunt
      figure still blocked up the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you force me to it," Emily said, quietly, "I must go to the doctor,
      and ask him to interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that?" Mrs. Ellmother said, quietly, on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do mean it," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old servant suddenly submitted&mdash;with a look which took Emily by
      surprise. She had expected to see anger; the face that now confronted her
      was a face subdued by sorrow and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wash my hands of it," Mrs. Ellmother said. "Go in&mdash;and take the
      consequences."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. MISS LETITIA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emily entered the room. The door was immediately closed on her from the
      outer side. Mrs. Ellmother's heavy steps were heard retreating along the
      passage. Then the banging of the door that led into the kitchen shook the
      flimsily-built cottage. Then, there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dim light of a lamp hidden away in a corner and screened by a dingy
      green shade, just revealed the closely-curtained bed, and the table near
      it bearing medicine-bottles and glasses. The only objects on the
      chimney-piece were a clock that had been stopped in mercy to the
      sufferer's irritable nerves, and an open case containing a machine for
      pouring drops into the eyes. The smell of fumigating pastilles hung
      heavily on the air. To Emily's excited imagination, the silence was like
      the silence of death. She approached the bed trembling. "Won't you speak
      to me, aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Emily? Who let you come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said I might come in, dear. Are you thirsty? I see some lemonade on
      the table. Shall I give it to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! If you open the bed-curtains, you let in the light. My poor eyes! Why
      are you here, my dear? Why are you not at the school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's holiday-time, aunt. Besides, I have left school for good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Left school?" Miss Letitia's memory made an effort, as she repeated those
      words. "You were going somewhere when you left school," she said, "and
      Cecilia Wyvil had something to do with it. Oh, my love, how cruel of you
      to go away to a stranger, when you might live here with me!" She paused&mdash;her
      sense of what she had herself just said began to grow confused. "What
      stranger?" she asked abruptly. "Was it a man? What name? Oh, my mind! Has
      death got hold of my mind before my body?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hush! I'll tell you the name. Sir Jervis Redwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know him. I don't want to know him. Do you think he means to send
      for you. Perhaps he <i>has</i> sent for you. I won't allow it! You shan't
      go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't excite yourself, dear! I have refused to go; I mean to stay here
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fevered brain held to its last idea. "<i>Has</i> he sent for you?" she
      said again, louder than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily replied once more, in terms carefully chosen with the one purpose of
      pacifying her. The attempt proved to be useless, and worse&mdash;it seemed
      to make her suspicious. "I won't be deceived!" she said; "I mean to know
      all about it. He did send for you. Whom did he send?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His housekeeper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What name?" The tone in which she put the question told of excitement
      that was rising to its climax. "Don't you know that I'm curious about
      names?" she burst out. "Why do you provoke me? Who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody you know, or need care about, dear aunt. Mrs. Rook."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly on the utterance of that name, there followed an unexpected
      result. Silence ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily waited&mdash;hesitated&mdash;advanced, to part the curtains, and
      look in at her aunt. She was stopped by a dreadful sound of laughter&mdash;the
      cheerless laughter that is heard among the mad. It suddenly ended in a
      dreary sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afraid to look in, she spoke, hardly knowing what she said. "Is there
      anything you wish for? Shall I call&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Letitia's voice interrupted her. Dull, low, rapidly muttering, it was
      unlike, shockingly unlike, the familiar voice of her aunt. It said strange
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Rook? What does Mrs. Rook matter? Or her husband either? Bony, Bony,
      you're frightened about nothing. Where's the danger of those two people
      turning up? Do you know how many miles away the village is? Oh, you fool&mdash;a
      hundred miles and more. Never mind the coroner, the coroner must keep in
      his own district&mdash;and the jury too. A risky deception? I call it a
      pious fraud. And I have a tender conscience, and a cultivated mind. The
      newspaper? How is <i>our</i> newspaper to find its way to her, I should
      like to know? You poor old Bony! Upon my word you do me good&mdash;you
      make me laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheerless laughter broke out again&mdash;and died away again drearily
      in a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed to decide rapidly in the ordinary emergencies of her life,
      Emily felt herself painfully embarrassed by the position in which she was
      now placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After what she had already heard, could she reconcile it to her sense of
      duty to her aunt to remain any longer in the room?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hopeless self-betrayal of delirium, Miss Letitia had revealed some
      act of concealment, committed in her past life, and confided to her
      faithful old servant. Under these circumstances, had Emily made any
      discoveries which convicted her of taking a base advantage of her position
      at the bedside? Most assuredly not! The nature of the act of concealment;
      the causes that had led to it; the person (or persons) affected by it&mdash;these
      were mysteries which left her entirely in the dark. She had found out that
      her aunt was acquainted with Mrs. Rook, and that was literally all she
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blameless, so far, in the line of conduct that she had pursued, might she
      still remain in the bed-chamber&mdash;on this distinct understanding with
      herself: that she would instantly return to the sitting-room if she heard
      anything which could suggest a doubt of Miss Letitia's claim to her
      affection and respect? After some hesitation, she decided on leaving it to
      her conscience to answer that question. Does conscience ever say, No&mdash;when
      inclination says, Yes? Emily's conscience sided with her reluctance to
      leave her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the time occupied by these reflections, the silence had
      remained unbroken. Emily began to feel uneasy. She timidly put her hand
      through the curtains, and took Miss Letitia's hand. The contact with the
      burning skin startled her. She turned away to the door, to call the
      servant&mdash;when the sound of her aunt's voice hurried her back to the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you there, Bony?" the voice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was her mind getting clear again? Emily tried the experiment of making a
      plain reply. "Your niece is with you," she said. "Shall I call the
      servant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Letitia's mind was still far away from Emily, and from the present
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The servant?" she repeated. "All the servants but you, Bony, have been
      sent away. London's the place for us. No gossiping servants and no curious
      neighbors in London. Bury the horrid truth in London. Ah, you may well say
      I look anxious and wretched. I hate deception&mdash;and yet, it must be
      done. Why do you waste time in talking? Why don't you find out where the
      vile woman lives? Only let me get at her&mdash;and I'll make Sara ashamed
      of herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's heart beat fast when she heard the woman's name. "Sara" (as she
      and her school-fellows knew) was the baptismal name of Miss Jethro. Had
      her aunt alluded to the disgraced teacher, or to some other woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited eagerly to hear more. There was nothing to be heard. At this
      most interesting moment, the silence remained undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fervor of her anxiety to set her doubts at rest, Emily's faith in
      her own good resolutions began to waver. The temptation to say something
      which might set her aunt talking again was too strong to be resisted&mdash;if
      she remained at the bedside. Despairing of herself she rose and turned to
      the door. In the moment that passed while she crossed the room the very
      words occurred to her that would suit her purpose. Her cheeks were hot
      with shame&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;she looked back at the bed&mdash;the
      words passed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara is only one of the woman's names," she said. "Do you like her other
      name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapidly-muttering tones broke out again instantly&mdash;but not in
      answer to Emily. The sound of a voice had encouraged Miss Letitia to
      pursue her own confused train of thought, and had stimulated the
      fast-failing capacity of speech to exert itself once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no! He's too cunning for you, and too cunning for me. He doesn't
      leave letters about; he destroys them all. Did I say he was too cunning
      for us? It's false. We are too cunning for him. Who found the morsels of
      his letter in the basket? Who stuck them together? Ah, <i>we</i> know!
      Don't read it, Bony. 'Dear Miss Jethro'&mdash;don't read it again. 'Miss
      Jethro' in his letter; and 'Sara,' when he talks to himself in the garden.
      Oh, who would have believed it of him, if we hadn't seen and heard it
      ourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more doubt now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who was the man, so bitterly and so regretfully alluded to?
    </p>
    <p>
      No: this time Emily held firmly by the resolution which bound her to
      respect the helpless position of her aunt. The speediest way of summoning
      Mrs. Ellmother would be to ring the bell. As she touched the handle a
      faint cry of suffering from the bed called her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, so thirsty!" murmured the failing voice&mdash;"so thirsty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She parted the curtains. The shrouded lamplight just showed her the green
      shade over Miss Letitia's eyes&mdash;the hollow cheeks below it&mdash;the
      arms laid helplessly on the bed-clothes. "Oh, aunt, don't you know my
      voice? Don't you know Emily? Let me kiss you, dear!" Useless to plead with
      her; useless to kiss her; she only reiterated the words, "So thirsty! so
      thirsty!" Emily raised the poor tortured body with a patient caution which
      spared it pain, and put the glass to her aunt's lips. She drank the
      lemonade to the last drop. Refreshed for the moment, she spoke again&mdash;spoke
      to the visionary servant of her delirious fancy, while she rested in
      Emily's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake, take care how you answer if she questions you. If <i>she</i>
      knew what <i>we</i> know! Are men ever ashamed? Ha! the vile woman! the
      vile woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, sinking gradually, dropped to a whisper. The next few words
      that escaped her were muttered inarticulately. Little by little, the false
      energy of fever was wearing itself out. She lay silent and still. To look
      at her now was to look at the image of death. Once more, Emily kissed her&mdash;closed
      the curtains&mdash;and rang the bell. Mrs. Ellmother failed to appear.
      Emily left the room to call her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the top of the kitchen stairs, she noted a slight change. The
      door below, which she had heard banged on first entering her aunt's room,
      now stood open. She called to Mrs. Ellmother. A strange voice answered
      her. Its accent was soft and courteous; presenting the strongest
      imaginable contrast to the harsh tones of Miss Letitia's crabbed old maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything I can do for you, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The person making this polite inquiry appeared at the foot of the stairs&mdash;a
      plump and comely woman of middle age. She looked up at the young lady with
      a pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," Emily said; "I had no intention of disturbing you. I
      called to Mrs. Ellmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger advanced a little way up the stairs, and answered, "Mrs.
      Ellmother is not here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you expect her back soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, miss&mdash;I don't expect her back at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that she has left the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss. She has left the house."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. MRS. MOSEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emily's first act&mdash;after the discovery of Mrs. Ellmother's
      incomprehensible disappearance&mdash;was to invite the new servant to
      follow her into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you explain this?" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask if you have come here by Mrs. Ellmother's invitation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Mrs. Ellmother's <i>request</i>, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you tell me how she came to make the request?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure, miss. Perhaps&mdash;as you find me here, a stranger to
      yourself, in place of the customary servant&mdash;I ought to begin by
      giving you a reference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, perhaps (if you will be so kind), by mentioning your name," Emily
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for reminding me, miss. My name is Elizabeth Mosey. I am well
      known to the gentleman who attends Miss Letitia. Dr. Allday will speak to
      my character and also to my experience as a nurse. If it would be in any
      way satisfactory to give you a second reference&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite needless, Mrs. Mosey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me to thank you again, miss. I was at home this evening, when Mrs.
      Ellmother called at my lodgings. Says she, 'I have come here, Elizabeth,
      to ask a favor of you for old friendship's sake.' Says I, 'My dear, pray
      command me, whatever it may be.' If this seems rather a hasty answer to
      make, before I knew what the favor was, might I ask you to bear in mind
      that Mrs. Ellmother put it to me 'for old friendship's sake'&mdash;alluding
      to my late husband, and to the business which we carried on at that time?
      Through no fault of ours, we got into difficulties. Persons whom we had
      trusted proved unworthy. Not to trouble you further, I may say at once, we
      should have been ruined, if our old friend Mrs. Ellmother had not come
      forward, and trusted us with the savings of her lifetime. The money was
      all paid back again, before my husband's death. But I don't consider&mdash;and,
      I think you won't consider&mdash;that the obligation was paid back too.
      Prudent or not prudent, there is nothing Mrs. Ellmother can ask of me that
      I am not willing to do. If I have put myself in an awkward situation (and
      I don't deny that it looks so) this is the only excuse, miss, that I can
      make for my conduct."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mosey was too fluent, and too fond of hearing the sound of her own
      eminently persuasive voice. Making allowance for these little drawbacks,
      the impression that she produced was decidedly favorable; and, however
      rashly she might have acted, her motive was beyond reproach. Having said
      some kind words to this effect, Emily led her back to the main interest of
      her narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Mrs. Ellmother give no reason for leaving my aunt, at such a time as
      this?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very words I said to her, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did she say, by way of reply?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She burst out crying&mdash;a thing I have never known her to do before,
      in an experience of twenty years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she really asked you to take her place here, at a moment's notice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was just what she did," Mrs. Mosey answered. "I had no need to tell
      her I was astonished; my lips spoke for me, no doubt. She's a hard woman
      in speech and manner, I admit. But there's more feeling in her than you
      would suppose. 'If you are the good friend I take you for,' she says,
      'don't ask me for reasons; I am doing what is forced on me, and doing it
      with a heavy heart.' In my place, miss, would you have insisted on her
      explaining herself, after that? The one thing I naturally wanted to know
      was, if I could speak to some lady, in the position of mistress here,
      before I ventured to intrude. Mrs. Ellmother understood that it was her
      duty to help me in this particular. Your poor aunt being out of the
      question she mentioned you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did she speak of me? In an angry way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed&mdash;quite the contrary. She says, 'You will find Miss Emily
      at the cottage. She is Miss Letitia's niece. Everybody likes her&mdash;and
      everybody is right.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She really said that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those were her words. And, what is more, she gave me a message for you at
      parting. 'If Miss Emily is surprised' (that was how she put it) 'give her
      my duty and good wishes; and tell her to remember what I said, when she
      took my place at her aunt's bedside.' I don't presume to inquire what this
      means," said Mrs. Mosey respectfully, ready to hear what it meant, if
      Emily would only be so good as to tell her. "I deliver the message, miss,
      as it was delivered to me. After which, Mrs. Ellmother went her way, and I
      went mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know where she went?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you nothing more to tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing more; except that she gave me my directions, of course, about the
      nursing. I took them down in writing&mdash;and you will find them in their
      proper place, with the prescriptions and the medicines."
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting at once on this hint, Emily led the way to her aunt's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Letitia was silent, when the new nurse softly parted the curtains&mdash;looked
      in&mdash;and drew them together again. Consulting her watch, Mrs. Mosey
      compared her written directions with the medicine-bottles on the table,
      and set one apart to be used at the appointed time. "Nothing, so far, to
      alarm us," she whispered. "You look sadly pale and tired, miss. Might I
      advise you to rest a little?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is any change, Mrs. Mosey&mdash;either for the better or the
      worse&mdash;of course you will let me know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily returned to the sitting-room: not to rest (after all that she had
      heard), but to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid much that was unintelligible, certain plain conclusions presented
      themselves to her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      After what the doctor had already said to Emily, on the subject of
      delirium generally, Mrs. Ellmother's proceedings became intelligible: they
      proved that she knew by experience the perilous course taken by her
      mistress's wandering thoughts, when they expressed themselves in words.
      This explained the concealment of Miss Letitia's illness from her niece,
      as well as the reiterated efforts of the old servant to prevent Emily from
      entering the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the event which had just happened&mdash;that is to say, Mrs.
      Ellmother's sudden departure from the cottage&mdash;was not only of
      serious importance in itself, but pointed to a startling conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faithful maid had left the mistress, whom she had loved and served,
      sinking under a fatal illness&mdash;and had put another woman in her
      place, careless of what that woman might discover by listening at the
      bedside&mdash;rather than confront Emily after she had been within hearing
      of her aunt while the brain of the suffering woman was deranged by fever.
      There was the state of the case, in plain words.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what frame of mind had Mrs. Ellmother adopted this desperate course of
      action?
    </p>
    <p>
      To use her own expression, she had deserted Miss Letitia "with a heavy
      heart." To judge by her own language addressed to Mrs. Mosey, she had left
      Emily to the mercy of a stranger&mdash;animated, nevertheless, by sincere
      feelings of attachment and respect. That her fears had taken for granted
      suspicion which Emily had not felt, and discoveries which Emily had (as
      yet) not made, in no way modified the serious nature of the inference
      which her conduct justified. The disclosure which this woman dreaded&mdash;who
      could doubt it now?&mdash;directly threatened Emily's peace of mind. There
      was no disguising it: the innocent niece was associated with an act of
      deception, which had been, until that day, the undetected secret of the
      aunt and the aunt's maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this conclusion, and in this only, was to be found the rational
      explanation of Mrs. Ellmother's choice&mdash;placed between the
      alternatives of submitting to discovery by Emily, or of leaving the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss Letitia's writing-table stood near the window of the
      sitting-room. Shrinking from the further pursuit of thoughts which might
      end in disposing her mind to distrust of her dying aunt, Emily looked
      round in search of some employment sufficiently interesting to absorb her
      attention. The writing-table reminded her that she owed a letter to
      Cecilia. That helpful friend had surely the first claim to know why she
      had failed to keep her engagement with Sir Jervis Redwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      After mentioning the telegram which had followed Mrs. Rook's arrival at
      the school, Emily's letter proceeded in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as I had in some degree recovered myself, I informed Mrs. Rook of
      my aunt's serious illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Although she carefully confined herself to commonplace expressions of
      sympathy, I could see that it was equally a relief to both of us to feel
      that we were prevented from being traveling companions. Don't suppose that
      I have taken a capricious dislike to Mrs. Rook&mdash;or that you are in
      any way to blame for the unfavorable impression which she has produced on
      me. I will make this plain when we meet. In the meanwhile, I need only
      tell you that I gave her a letter of explanation to present to Sir Jervis
      Redwood. I also informed him of my address in London: adding a request
      that he would forward your letter, in case you have written to me before
      you receive these lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kind Mr. Alban Morris accompanied me to the railway-station, and arranged
      with the guard to take special care of me on the journey to London. We
      used to think him rather a heartless man. We were quite wrong. I don't
      know what his plans are for spending the summer holidays. Go where he may,
      I remember his kindness; my best wishes go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I must not sadden your enjoyment of your pleasant visit to the
      Engadine, by writing at any length of the sorrow that I am suffering. You
      know how I love my aunt, and how gratefully I have always felt her
      motherly goodness to me. The doctor does not conceal the truth. At her
      age, there is no hope: my father's last-left relation, my one dearest
      friend, is dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I must not forget that I have another friend&mdash;I must find some
      comfort in thinking of <i>you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do so long in my solitude for a letter from my dear Cecilia. Nobody
      comes to see me, when I most want sympathy; I am a stranger in this vast
      city. The members of my mother's family are settled in Australia: they
      have not even written to me, in all the long years that have passed since
      her death. You remember how cheerfully I used to look forward to my new
      life, on leaving school? Good-by, my darling. While I can see your sweet
      face, in my thoughts, I don't despair&mdash;dark as it looks now&mdash;of
      the future that is before me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily had closed and addressed her letter, and was just rising from her
      chair, when she heard the voice of the new nurse at the door.

      CHAPTER XV. EMILY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "May I say a word?" Mrs. Mosey inquired. She entered the room&mdash;pale
      and trembling. Seeing that ominous change, Emily dropped back into her
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead?" she said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mosey looked at her in vacant surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to say, miss, that your aunt has frightened me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even that vague allusion was enough for Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need say no more," she replied. "I know but too well how my aunt's
      mind is affected by the fever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused and frightened as she was, Mrs. Mosey still found relief in her
      customary flow of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many and many a person have I nursed in fever," she announced. "Many and
      many a person have I heard say strange things. Never yet, miss, in all my
      experience&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell me of it!" Emily interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but I <i>must</i> tell you! In your own interests, Miss Emily&mdash;in
      your own interests. I won't be inhuman enough to leave you alone in the
      house to-night; but if this delirium goes on, I must ask you to get
      another nurse. Shocking suspicions are lying in wait for me in that
      bedroom, as it were. I can't resist them as I ought, if I go back again,
      and hear your aunt saying what she has been saying for the last half hour
      and more. Mrs. Ellmother has expected impossibilities of me; and Mrs.
      Ellmother must take the consequences. I don't say she didn't warn me&mdash;speaking,
      you will please to understand, in the strictest confidence. 'Elizabeth,'
      she says, 'you know how wildly people talk in Miss Letitia's present
      condition. Pay no heed to it,' she says. 'Let it go in at one ear and out
      at the other,' she says. 'If Miss Emily asks questions&mdash;you know
      nothing about it. If she's frightened&mdash;you know nothing about it. If
      she bursts into fits of crying that are dreadful to see, pity her, poor
      thing, but take no notice.' All very well, and sounds like speaking out,
      doesn't it? Nothing of the sort! Mrs. Ellmother warns me to expect this,
      that, and the other. But there is one horrid thing (which I heard, mind,
      over and over again at your aunt's bedside) that she does <i>not</i>
      prepare me for; and that horrid thing is&mdash;Murder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that last word, Mrs. Mosey dropped her voice to a whisper&mdash;and
      waited to see what effect she had produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorely tried already by the cruel perplexities of her position, Emily's
      courage failed to resist the first sensation of horror, aroused in her by
      the climax of the nurse's hysterical narrative. Encouraged by her silence,
      Mrs. Mosey went on. She lifted one hand with theatrical solemnity&mdash;and
      luxuriously terrified herself with her own horrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An inn, Miss Emily; a lonely inn, somewhere in the country; and a
      comfortless room at the inn, with a makeshift bed at one end of it, and a
      makeshift bed at the other&mdash;I give you my word of honor, that was how
      your aunt put it. She spoke of two men next; two men asleep (you
      understand) in the two beds. I think she called them 'gentlemen'; but I
      can't be sure, and I wouldn't deceive you&mdash;you know I wouldn't
      deceive you, for the world. Miss Letitia muttered and mumbled, poor soul.
      I own I was getting tired of listening&mdash;when she burst out plain
      again, in that one horrid word&mdash;Oh, miss, don't be impatient! don't
      interrupt me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily did interrupt, nevertheless. In some degree at least she had
      recovered herself. "No more of it!" she said&mdash;"I won't hear a word
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Mosey was too resolutely bent on asserting her own importance, by
      making the most of the alarm that she had suffered, to be repressed by any
      ordinary method of remonstrance. Without paying the slightest attention to
      what Emily had said, she went on again more loudly and more excitably than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, miss&mdash;listen! The dreadful part of it is to come; you
      haven't heard about the two gentlemen yet. One of them was murdered&mdash;what
      do you think of that!&mdash;and the other (I heard your aunt say it, in so
      many words) committed the crime. Did Miss Letitia fancy she was addressing
      a lot of people when <i>you</i> were nursing her? She called out, like a
      person making public proclamation, when I was in her room. 'Whoever you
      are, good people' (she says), 'a hundred pounds reward, if you find the
      runaway murderer. Search everywhere for a poor weak womanish creature,
      with rings on his little white hands. There's nothing about him like a
      man, except his voice&mdash;a fine round voice. You'll know him, my
      friends&mdash;the wretch, the monster&mdash;you'll know him by his voice.'
      That was how she put it; I tell you again, that was how she put it. Did
      you hear her scream? Ah, my dear young lady, so much the better for you!
      'O the horrid murder' (she says)&mdash;'hush it up!' I'll take my Bible
      oath before the magistrate," cried Mrs. Mosey, starting out of her chair,
      "your aunt said, 'Hush it up!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily crossed the room. The energy of her character was roused at last.
      She seized the foolish woman by the shoulders, forced her back in the
      chair, and looked her straight in the face without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, Mrs. Mosey was petrified. She had fully expected&mdash;having
      reached the end of her terrible story&mdash;to find Emily at her feet,
      entreating her not to carry out her intention of leaving the cottage the
      next morning; and she had determined, after her sense of her own
      importance had been sufficiently flattered, to grant the prayer of the
      helpless young lady. Those were her anticipations&mdash;and how had they
      been fulfilled? She had been treated like a mad woman in a state of
      revolt!
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you assault me?" she asked piteously. "You ought to be ashamed
      of yourself. God knows I meant well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not the first person," Emily answered, quietly releasing her,
      "who has done wrong with the best intentions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did my duty, miss, when I told you what your aunt said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot your duty when you listened to what my aunt said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to explain myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: not a word more on <i>that</i> subject shall pass between us. Remain
      here, if you please; I have something to suggest in your own interests.
      Wait, and compose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose which had taken a foremost place in Emily's mind rested on the
      firm foundation of her love and pity for her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that she had regained the power to think, she felt a hateful doubt
      pressed on her by Mrs. Mosey's disclosures. Having taken for granted that
      there was a foundation in truth for what she herself had heard in her
      aunt's room, could she reasonably resist the conclusion that there must be
      a foundation in truth for what Mrs. Mosey had heard, under similar
      circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one way of escaping from this dilemma&mdash;and Emily
      deliberately took it. She turned her back on her own convictions; and
      persuaded herself that she had been in the wrong, when she had attached
      importance to anything that her aunt had said, under the influence of
      delirium. Having adopted this conclusion, she resolved to face the
      prospect of a night's solitude by the death-bed&mdash;rather than permit
      Mrs. Mosey to have a second opportunity of drawing her own inferences from
      what she might hear in Miss Letitia's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to keep me waiting much longer, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a moment longer, now you are composed again," Emily answered. "I have
      been thinking of what has happened; and I fail to see any necessity for
      putting off your departure until the doctor comes to-morrow morning. There
      is really no objection to your leaving me to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, miss; there <i>is</i> an objection. I have already
      told you I can't reconcile it to my conscience to leave you here by
      yourself. I am not an inhuman woman," said Mrs. Mosey, putting her
      handkerchief to her eyes&mdash;smitten with pity for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily tried the effect of a conciliatory reply. "I am grateful for your
      kindness in offering to stay with me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good of you, I'm sure," Mrs. Mosey answered ironically. "But for all
      that, you persist in sending me away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I persist in thinking that there is no necessity for my keeping you here
      until to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, have it your own way! I am not reduced to forcing my company on
      anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mosey put her handkerchief in her pocket, and asserted her dignity.
      With head erect and slowly-marching steps she walked out of the room.
      Emily was left in the cottage, alone with her dying aunt.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. MISS JETHRO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A fortnight after the disappearance of Mrs. Ellmother, and the dismissal
      of Mrs. Mosey, Doctor Allday entered his consulting-room, punctual to the
      hour at which he was accustomed to receive patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      An occasional wrinkling of his eyebrows, accompanied by an intermittent
      restlessness in his movements, appeared to indicate some disturbance of
      this worthy man's professional composure. His mind was indeed not at ease.
      Even the inexcitable old doctor had felt the attraction which had already
      conquered three such dissimilar people as Alban Morris, Cecilia Wyvil, and
      Francine de Sor. He was thinking of Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring at the door-bell announced the arrival of the first patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant introduced a tall lady, dressed simply and elegantly in dark
      apparel. Noticeable features, of a Jewish cast&mdash;worn and haggard, but
      still preserving their grandeur of form&mdash;were visible through her
      veil. She moved with grace and dignity; and she stated her object in
      consulting Doctor Allday with the ease of a well-bred woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come to ask your opinion, sir, on the state of my heart," she said;
      "and I am recommended by a patient, who has consulted you with advantage
      to herself." She placed a card on the doctor's writing-desk, and added: "I
      have become acquainted with the lady, by being one of the lodgers in her
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor recognized the name&mdash;and the usual proceedings ensued.
      After careful examination, he arrived at a favorable conclusion. "I may
      tell you at once," he said&mdash;"there is no reason to be alarmed about
      the state of your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never felt any alarm about myself," she answered quietly. "A
      sudden death is an easy death. If one's affairs are settled, it seems, on
      that account, to be the death to prefer. My object was to settle <i>my</i>
      affairs&mdash;such as they are&mdash;if you had considered my life to be
      in danger. Is there nothing the matter with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say that," the doctor replied. "The action of your heart is very
      feeble. Take the medicine that I shall prescribe; pay a little more
      attention to eating and drinking than ladies usually do; don't run
      upstairs, and don't fatigue yourself by violent exercise&mdash;and I see
      no reason why you shouldn't live to be an old woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid!" the lady said to herself. She turned away, and looked out of
      the window with a bitter smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday wrote his prescription. "Are you likely to make a long stay
      in London?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am here for a little while only. Do you wish to see me again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see you once more, before you go away&mdash;if you can
      make it convenient. What name shall I put on the prescription?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A remarkable name," the doctor said, in his matter-of-fact way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro's bitter smile showed itself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without otherwise noticing what Doctor Allday had said, she laid the
      consultation fee on the table. At the same moment, the footman appeared
      with a letter. "From Miss Emily Brown," he said. "No answer required."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held the door open as he delivered the message, seeing that Miss Jethro
      was about to leave the room. She dismissed him by a gesture; and,
      returning to the table, pointed to the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was your correspondent lately a pupil at Miss Ladd's school?" she
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My correspondent has just left Miss Ladd," the doctor answered. "Are you
      a friend of hers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am acquainted with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would be doing the poor child a kindness, if you would go and see
      her. She has no friends in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me&mdash;she has an aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her aunt died a week since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there no other relations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None. A melancholy state of things, isn't it? She would have been
      absolutely alone in the house, if I had not sent one of my women servants
      to stay with her for the present. Did you know her father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro passed over the question, as if she had not heard it. "Has the
      young lady dismissed her aunt's servants?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her aunt kept but one servant, ma'am. The woman has spared Miss Emily the
      trouble of dismissing her." He briefly alluded to Mrs. Ellmother's
      desertion of her mistress. "I can't explain it," he said when he had done.
      "Can <i>you</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think, sir, that I can help you? I have never even heard
      of the servant&mdash;and the mistress was a stranger to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Doctor Allday's age a man is not easily discouraged by reproof, even
      when it is administered by a handsome woman. "I thought you might have
      known Miss Emily's father," he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro rose, and wished him good-morning. "I must not occupy any more
      of your valuable time," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you wait a minute?" the doctor suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impenetrable as ever, he rang the bell. "Any patients in the
      waiting-room?" he inquired. "You see I have time to spare," he resumed,
      when the man had replied in the negative. "I take an interest in this poor
      girl; and I thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you think that I take an interest in her, too," Miss Jethro
      interposed, "you are perfectly right&mdash;I knew her father," she added
      abruptly; the allusion to Emily having apparently reminded her of the
      question which she had hitherto declined to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," Doctor Allday proceeded, "I want a word of advice. Won't
      you sit down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a chair in silence. An irregular movement in the lower part of
      her veil seemed to indicate that she was breathing with difficulty. The
      doctor observed her with close attention. "Let me see my prescription
      again," he said. Having added an ingredient, he handed it back with a word
      of explanation. "Your nerves are more out of order than I supposed. The
      hardest disease to cure that I know of is&mdash;worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hint could hardly have been plainer; but it was lost on Miss Jethro.
      Whatever her troubles might be, her medical adviser was not made
      acquainted with them. Quietly folding up the prescription, she reminded
      him that he had proposed to ask her advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way can I be of service to you?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid I must try your patience," the doctor acknowledged, "if I am
      to answer that question plainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these prefatory words, he described the events that had followed Mrs.
      Mosey's appearance at the cottage. "I am only doing justice to this
      foolish woman," he continued, "when I tell you that she came here, after
      she had left Miss Emily, and did her best to set matters right. I went to
      the poor girl directly&mdash;and I felt it my duty, after looking at her
      aunt, not to leave her alone for that night. When I got home the next
      morning, whom do you think I found waiting for me? Mrs. Ellmother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped&mdash;in the expectation that Miss Jethro would express some
      surprise. Not a word passed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Ellmother's object was to ask how her mistress was going on," the
      doctor proceeded. "Every day while Miss Letitia still lived, she came here
      to make the same inquiry&mdash;without a word of explanation. On the day
      of the funeral, there she was at the church, dressed in deep mourning;
      and, as I can personally testify, crying bitterly. When the ceremony was
      over&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;she slipped away before Miss Emily or
      I could speak to her. We have seen nothing more of her, and heard nothing
      more, from that time to this."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped again, the silent lady still listening without making any
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you no opinion to express?" the doctor asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am waiting," Miss Jethro answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waiting&mdash;for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't heard yet, why you want my advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday's observation of humanity had hitherto reckoned want of
      caution among the deficient moral qualities in the natures of women. He
      set down Miss Jethro as a remarkable exception to a general rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you to advise me as to the right course to take with Miss Emily,"
      he said. "She has assured me she attaches no serious importance to her
      aunt's wanderings, when the poor old lady's fever was at its worst. I
      don't doubt that she speaks the truth&mdash;but I have my own reasons for
      being afraid that she is deceiving herself. Will you bear this in mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;if it's necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In plain words, Miss Jethro, you think I am still wandering from the
      point. I have got to the point. Yesterday, Miss Emily told me that she
      hoped to be soon composed enough to examine the papers left by her aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro suddenly turned in her chair, and looked at Doctor Allday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you beginning to feel interested?" the doctor asked mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She neither acknowledged nor denied it. "Go on"&mdash;was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how <i>you</i> feel," he proceeded; "<i>I</i> am afraid of
      the discoveries which she may make; and I am strongly tempted to advise
      her to leave the proposed examination to her aunt's lawyer. Is there
      anything in your knowledge of Miss Emily's late father, which tells you
      that I am right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I reply," said Miss Jethro, "it may not be amiss to let the young
      lady speak for herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is she to do that?" the doctor asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro pointed to the writing table. "Look there," she said. "You
      have not yet opened Miss Emily's letter."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. DOCTOR ALLDAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Absorbed in the effort to overcome his patient's reserve, the doctor had
      forgotten Emily's letter. He opened it immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading the first sentence, he looked up with an expression of
      annoyance. "She has begun the examination of the papers already," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can be of no further use to you," Miss Jethro rejoined. She made a
      second attempt to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday turned to the next page of the letter. "Stop!" he cried.
      "She has found something&mdash;and here it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up a small printed Handbill, which had been placed between the
      first and second pages. "Suppose you look at it?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether I am interested in it or not?" Miss Jethro asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be interested in what Miss Emily says about it in her letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you propose to show me her letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I propose to read it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro took the Handbill without further objection. It was expressed
      in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "MURDER. 100 POUNDS REWARD.&mdash;Whereas a murder was committed on the
      thirtieth September, 1877, at the Hand-in-Hand Inn, in the village of
      Zeeland, Hampshire, the above reward will be paid to any person or persons
      whose exertions shall lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspected
      murderer. Name not known. Supposed age, between twenty and thirty years. A
      well-made man, of small stature. Fair complexion, delicate features, clear
      blue eye s. Hair light, and cut rather short. Clean shaven, with the
      exception of narrow half-whiskers. Small, white, well-shaped hands. Wore
      valuable rings on the two last fingers of the left hand. Dressed neatly in
      a dark-gray tourist-suit. Carried a knapsack, as if on a pedestrian
      excursion. Remarkably good voice, smooth, full, and persuasive.
      Ingratiating manners. Apply to the Chief Inspector, Metropolitan Police
      Office, London."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro laid aside the Handbill without any visible appearance of
      agitation. The doctor took up Emily's letter, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be as much relieved as I was, my kind friend, when you look at
      the paper inclosed. I found it loose in a blank book, with cuttings from
      newspapers, and odd announcements of lost property and other curious
      things (all huddled together between the leaves), which my aunt no doubt
      intended to set in order and fix in their proper places. She must have
      been thinking of her book, poor soul, in her last illness. Here is the
      origin of those 'terrible words' which frightened stupid Mrs. Mosey! Is it
      not encouraging to have discovered such a confirmation of my opinion as
      this? I feel a new interest in looking over the papers that still remain
      to be examined&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could get to the end of the sentence Miss Jethro's agitation
      broke through her reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do what you proposed to do!" she burst out vehemently. "Stop her at once
      from carrying her examination any further! If she hesitates, insist on
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Doctor Allday had triumphed! "It has been a long time coming," he
      remarked, in his cool way; "and it's all the more welcome on that account.
      You dread the discoveries she may make, Miss Jethro, as I do. And <i>you</i>
      know what those discoveries may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I do know, or don't know, is of no importance." she answered
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, it is of very serious importance. I have no authority over
      this poor girl&mdash;I am not even an old friend. You tell me to insist.
      Help me to declare honestly that I know of circumstances which justify me;
      and I may insist to some purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro lifted her veil for the first time, and eyed him searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I can trust you," she said. "Now listen! The one consideration
      on which I consent to open my lips, is consideration for Miss Emily's
      tranquillity. Promise me absolute secrecy, on your word of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know one thing, first," Miss Jethro proceeded. "Did she tell
      you&mdash;as she once told me&mdash;that her father had died of
      heart-complaint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you put any questions to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked how long ago it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish to know, Doctor Allday, what discoveries Miss Emily may yet
      make, among her aunt's papers. Judge for yourself, when I tell you that
      she has been deceived about her father's death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that he is still living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that she has been deceived&mdash;purposely deceived&mdash;about
      the <i>manner</i> of his death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was the wretch who did it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wronging the dead, sir! The truth can only have been concealed
      out of the purest motives of love and pity. I don't desire to disguise the
      conclusion at which I have arrived after what I have heard from yourself.
      The person responsible must be Miss Emily's aunt&mdash;and the old servant
      must have been in her confidence. Remember! You are bound in honor not to
      repeat to any living creature what I have just said."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor followed Miss Jethro to the door. "You have not yet told me,"
      he said, "<i>how</i> her father died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no more to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words she left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang for his servant. To wait until the hour at which he was accustomed
      to go out, might be to leave Emily's peace of mind at the mercy of an
      accident. "I am going to the cottage," he said. "If anybody wants me, I
      shall be back in a quarter of an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the point of leaving the house, he remembered that Emily would probably
      expect him to return the Handbill. As he took it up, the first lines
      caught his eye: he read the date at which the murder had been committed,
      for the second time. On a sudden the ruddy color left his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!" he cried, "her father was murdered&mdash;and that woman was
      concerned in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the impulse that urged him, he secured the Handbill in his
      pocketbook&mdash;snatched up the card which his patient had presented as
      her introduction&mdash;and instantly left the house. He called the first
      cab that passed him, and drove to Miss Jethro's lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone"&mdash;was the servant's answer when he inquired for her. He
      insisted on speaking to the landlady. "Hardly ten minutes have passed," he
      said, "since she left my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly ten minutes have passed," the landlady replied, "since that
      message was brought here by a boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The message had been evidently written in great haste: "I am unexpectedly
      obliged to leave London. A bank note is inclosed in payment of my debt to
      you. I will send for my luggage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unexpectedly obliged to leave London," he repeated, as he got into the
      cab again. "Her flight condemns her: not a doubt of it now. As fast as you
      can!" he shouted to the man; directing him to drive to Emily's cottage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. MISS LADD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arriving at the cottage, Doctor Allday discovered a gentleman, who was
      just closing the garden gate behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Miss Emily had a visitor?" he inquired, when the servant admitted
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentleman left a letter for Miss Emily, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he ask to see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked after Miss Letitia's health. When he heard that she was dead, he
      seemed to be startled, and went away immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he give his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor found Emily absorbed over her letter. His anxiety to forestall
      any possible discovery of the deception which had concealed the terrible
      story of her father's death, kept Doctor Allday's vigilance on the watch.
      He doubted the gentleman who had abstained from giving his name; he even
      distrusted the other unknown person who had written to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up. Her face relieved him of his misgivings, before she could
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last, I have heard from my dearest friend," she said. "You remember
      what I told you about Cecilia? Here is a letter&mdash;a long delightful
      letter&mdash;from the Engadine, left at the door by some gentleman
      unknown. I was questioning the servant when you rang the bell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may question me, if you prefer it. I arrived just as the gentleman
      was shutting your garden gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, tell me! what was he like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tall, and thin, and dark. Wore a vile republican-looking felt hat. Had
      nasty ill-tempered wrinkles between his eyebrows. The sort of man I
      distrust by instinct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he doesn't shave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that he wore a beard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; a curly black beard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily clasped her hands in amazement. "Can it be Alban Morris?" she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at her with a sardonic smile; he thought it likely that
      he had discovered her sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Mr. Alban Morris?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The drawing-master at Miss Ladd's school."
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday dropped the subject: masters at ladies' schools were not
      persons who interested him. He returned to the purpose which had brought
      him to the cottage&mdash;and produced the Handbill that had been sent to
      him in Emily's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you want to have it back again?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it from him, and looked at it with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it strange," she suggested, "that the murderer should have escaped,
      with such a careful description of him as this circulated all over
      England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She read the description to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Name not known. Supposed age, between twenty-five and thirty years. A
      well-made man, of small stature. Fair complexion, delicate features, clear
      blue eyes. Hair light, and cut rather short. Clean shaven, with the
      exception of narrow half-whiskers. Small, white, well-shaped hands. Wore
      valuable rings on the two last fingers of the left hand. Dressed neatly&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That part of the description is useless," the doctor remarked; "he would
      change his clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But could he change his voice?" Emily objected. "Listen to this:
      'Remarkably good voice, smooth, full, and persuasive.' And here again!
      'Ingratiating manners.' Perhaps you will say he could put on an appearance
      of rudeness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will say this, my dear. He would be able to disguise himself so
      effectually that ninety-nine people out of a hundred would fail to
      identify him, either by his voice or his manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look back at the description: 'Hair cut rather short, clean shaven, with
      the exception of narrow half-whiskers.' The wretch was safe from pursuit;
      he had ample time at his disposal&mdash;don't you see how he could
      completely alter the appearance of his head and face? No more, my dear, of
      this disagreeable subject! Let us get to something interesting. Have you
      found anything else among your aunt's papers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have met with a great disappointment," Emily replied. "Did I tell you
      how I discovered the Handbill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found it, with the scrap-book and the newspaper cuttings, under a
      collection of empty boxes and bottles, in a drawer of the washhand-stand.
      And I naturally expected to make far more interesting discoveries in this
      room. My search was over in five minutes. Nothing in the cabinet there, in
      the corner, but a few books and some china. Nothing in the writing-desk,
      on that side-table, but a packet of note-paper and some sealing-wax.
      Nothing here, in the drawers, but tradesmen's receipts, materials for
      knitting, and old photographs. She must have destroyed all her papers,
      poor dear, before her last illness; and the Handbill and the other things
      can only have escaped, because they were left in a place which she never
      thought of examining. Isn't it provoking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With a mind inexpressibly relieved, good Doctor Allday asked permission to
      return to his patients: leaving Emily to devote herself to her friend's
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way out, he noticed that the door of the bed-chamber on the
      opposite side of the passage stood open. Since Miss Letitia's death the
      room had not been used. Well within view stood the washhand-stand to which
      Emily had alluded. The doctor advanced to the house door&mdash;reflected&mdash;hesitated&mdash;and
      looked toward the empty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had struck him that there might be a second drawer which Emily had
      overlooked. Would he be justified in setting this doubt at rest? If he
      passed over ordinary scruples it would not be without excuse. Miss Letitia
      had spoken to him of her affairs, and had asked him to act (in Emily's
      interest) as co-executor with her lawyer. The rapid progress of the
      illness had made it impossible for her to execute the necessary codicil.
      But the doctor had been morally (if not legally) taken into her confidence&mdash;and,
      for that reason, he decided that he had a right in this serious matter to
      satisfy his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance was enough to show him that no second drawer had been overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no other discovery to detain the doctor. The wardrobe only
      contained the poor old lady's clothes; the one cupboard was open and
      empty. On the point of leaving the room, he went back to the
      washhand-stand. While he had the opportunity, it might not be amiss to
      make sure that Emily had thoroughly examined those old boxes and bottles,
      which she had alluded to with some little contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawer was of considerable length. When he tried to pull it completely
      out from the grooves in which it ran, it resisted him. In his present
      frame of mind, this was a suspicious circumstance in itself. He cleared
      away the litter so as to make room for the introduction of his hand and
      arm into the drawer. In another moment his fingers touched a piece of
      paper, jammed between the inner end of the drawer and the bottom of the
      flat surface of the washhand-stand. With a little care, he succeeded in
      extricating the paper. Only pausing to satisfy himself that there was
      nothing else to be found, and to close the drawer after replacing its
      contents, he left the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab was waiting for him. On the drive back to his own house, he opened
      the crumpled paper. It proved to be a letter addressed to Miss Letitia;
      and it was signed by no less a person than Emily's schoolmistress. Looking
      back from the end to the beginning, Doctor Allday discovered, in the first
      sentence, the name of&mdash;Miss Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the interview of that morning with his patient he might have
      doubted the propriety of making himself further acquainted with the
      letter. As things were, he read it without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR MADAM&mdash;I cannot but regard it as providential circumstance that
      your niece, in writing to you from my house, should have mentioned, among
      other events of her school life, the arrival of my new teacher, Miss
      Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To say that I was surprised is to express very inadequately what I felt
      when I read your letter, informing me confidentially that I had employed a
      woman who was unworthy to associate with the young persons placed under my
      care. It is impossible for me to suppose that a lady in your position, and
      possessed of your high principles, would make such a serious accusation as
      this, without unanswerable reasons for doing so. At the same time I
      cannot, consistently with my duty as a Christian, suffer my opinion of
      Miss Jethro to be in any way modified, until proofs are laid before me
      which it is impossible to dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Placing the same confidence in your discretion, which you have placed in
      mine, I now inclose the references and testimonials which Miss Jethro
      submitted to me, when she presented herself to fill the vacant situation
      in my school.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I earnestly request you to lose no time in instituting the confidential
      inquiries which you have volunteered to make. Whatever the result may be,
      pray return to me the inclosures which I have trusted to your care, and
      believe me, dear madam, in much suspense and anxiety, sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      "AMELIA LADD."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to describe, at any length, the impression which these
      lines produced on the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had heard what Emily had heard at the time of her aunt's last
      illness, he would have called to mind Miss Letitia's betrayal of her
      interest in some man unknown, whom she believed to have been beguiled by
      Miss Jethro&mdash;and he would have perceived that the vindictive hatred,
      thus produced, must have inspired the letter of denunciation which the
      schoolmistress had acknowledged. He would also have inferred that Miss
      Letitia's inquiries had proved her accusation to be well founded&mdash;if
      he had known of the new teacher's sudden dismissal from the school. As
      things were, he was merely confirmed in his bad opinion of Miss Jethro;
      and he was induced, on reflection, to keep his discovery to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If poor Miss Emily saw the old lady exhibited in the character of an
      informer," he thought, "what a blow would be struck at her innocent
      respect for the memory of her aunt!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. SIR JERVIS REDWOOD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Emily, left by herself, had her own correspondence to
      occupy her attention. Besides the letter from Cecilia (directed to the
      care of Sir Jervis Redwood), she had received some lines addressed to her
      by Sir Jervis himself. The two inclosures had been secured in a sealed
      envelope, directed to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Alban Morris had been indeed the person trusted as messenger by Sir
      Jervis, the conclusion that followed filled Emily with overpowering
      emotions of curiosity and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having no longer the motive of serving and protecting her, Alban must,
      nevertheless, have taken the journey to Northumberland. He must have
      gained Sir Jervis Redwood's favor and confidence&mdash;and he might even
      have been a guest at the baronet's country seat&mdash;when Cecilia's
      letter arrived. What did it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked back at her experience of her last day at school, and
      recalled her consultation with Alban on the subject of Mrs. Rook. Was he
      still bent on clearing up his suspicions of Sir Jervis's housekeeper? And,
      with that end in view, had he followed the woman, on her return to her
      master's place of abode?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, almost irritably, Emily snatched up Sir Jervis's letter. Before
      the doctor had come in, she had glanced at it, and had thrown it aside in
      her impatience to read what Cecilia had written. In her present altered
      frame of mind, she was inclined to think that Sir Jervis might be the more
      interesting correspondent of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to his letter, she was disappointed at the outset.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, his handwriting was so abominably bad that she was
      obliged to guess at his meaning. In the second place, he never hinted at
      the circumstances under which Cecilia's letter had been confided to the
      gentleman who had left it at her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would once more have treated the baronet's communication with contempt&mdash;but
      for the discovery that it contained an offer of employment in London,
      addressed to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jervis had necessarily been obliged to engage another secretary in
      Emily's absence. But he was still in want of a person to serve his
      literary interests in London. He had reason to believe that discoveries
      made by modern travelers in Central America had been reported from time to
      time by the English press; and he wished copies to be taken of any notices
      of this sort which might be found, on referring to the files of newspapers
      kept in the reading-room of the British Museum. If Emily considered
      herself capable of contributing in this way to the completeness of his
      great work on "the ruined cities," she had only to apply to his bookseller
      in London, who would pay her the customary remuneration and give her every
      assistance of which she might stand in need. The bookseller's name and
      address followed (with nothing legible but the two words "Bond Street"),
      and there was an end of Sir Jervis's proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily laid it aside, deferring her answer until she had read Cecilia's
      letter.

      CHAPTER XX. THE REVEREND MILES MIRABEL.

      "I am making a little excursion from the Engadine, my dearest of all dear
      friends. Two charming fellow-travelers take care of me; and we may perhaps
      get as far as the Lake of Como.

      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is anything in me to be proud of, I think it must be my
      admirable appetite. And, if I have a passion, the name of it is Pastry.
      Here again, Lady Doris reciprocates my sentiments. We sit next to each
      other at the <i>table d'hote</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens, I have forgotten her husband! They have been married rather
      more than a month. Did I tell you that she is just two years older than I
      am?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare I am forgetting him again! He is Lord Janeaway. Such a quiet
      modest man, and so easily amused. He carries with him everywhere a dirty
      little tin case, with air holes in the cover. He goes softly poking about
      among bushes and brambles, and under rocks, and behind old wooden houses.
      When he has caught some hideous insect that makes one shudder, he blushes
      with pleasure, and looks at his wife and me, and says, with the prettiest
      lisp: 'This is what I call enjoying the day.' To see the manner in which
      he obeys Her is, between ourselves, to feel proud of being a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was I? Oh, at the <i>table d'hote</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, Emily&mdash;I say it with a solemn sense of the claims of truth&mdash;never
      have I eaten such an infamous, abominable, maddeningly bad dinner, as the
      dinner they gave us on our first day at the hotel. I ask you if I am not
      patient; I appeal to your own recollection of occasions when I have
      exhibited extraordinary self-control. My dear, I held out until they
      brought the pastry round. I took one bite, and committed the most shocking
      offense against good manners at table that you can imagine. My
      handkerchief, my poor innocent handkerchief, received the horrid&mdash;please
      suppose the rest. My hair stands on end, when I think of it. Our neighbors
      at the table saw me. The coarse men laughed. The sweet young bride,
      sincerely feeling for me, said, 'Will you allow me to shake hands? I did
      exactly what you have done the day before yesterday.' Such was the
      beginning of my friendship with Lady Doris Janeaway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are two resolute women&mdash;I mean that <i>she</i> is resolute, and
      that I follow her&mdash;and we have asserted our right of dining to our
      own satisfaction, by means of an interview with the chief cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This interesting person is an ex-Zouave in the French army. Instead of
      making excuses, he confessed that the barbarous tastes of the English and
      American visitors had so discouraged him, that he had lost all pride and
      pleasure in the exercise of his art. As an example of what he meant, he
      mentioned his experience of two young Englishmen who could speak no
      foreign language. The waiters reported that they objected to their
      breakfasts, and especially to the eggs. Thereupon (to translate the
      Frenchman's own way of putting it) he exhausted himself in exquisite
      preparations of eggs. <i>Eggs a la tripe, au gratin, a l'Aurore, a la
      Dauphine, a la Poulette, a la Tartare, a la Venitienne, a la Bordelaise</i>,
      and so on, and so on. Still the two young gentlemen were not satisfied.
      The ex-Zouave, infuriated; wounded in his honor, disgraced as a professor,
      insisted on an explanation. What, in heaven's name, <i>did</i> they want
      for breakfast? They wanted boiled eggs; and a fish which they called a <i>Bloaterre</i>.
      It was impossible, he said, to express his contempt for the English idea
      of a breakfast, in the presence of ladies. You know how a cat expresses
      herself in the presence of a dog&mdash;and you will understand the
      allusion. Oh, Emily, what dinners we have had, in our own room, since we
      spoke to that noble cook!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I any more news to send you? Are you interested, my dear, in
      eloquent young clergymen?
    </p>
    <p>
      "On our first appearance at the public table we noticed a remarkable air
      of depression among the ladies. Had some adventurous gentleman tried to
      climb a mountain, and failed? Had disastrous political news arrived from
      England; a defeat of the Conservatives, for instance? Had a revolution in
      the fashions broken out in Paris, and had all our best dresses become of
      no earthly value to us? I applied for information to the only lady present
      who shone on the company with a cheerful face&mdash;my friend Doris, of
      course. "'What day was yesterday?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sunday,' I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Of all melancholy Sundays,' she continued, the most melancholy in the
      calendar. Mr. Miles Mirabel preached his farewell sermon, in our temporary
      chapel upstairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And you have not recovered it yet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We are all heart-broken, Miss Wyvil.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This naturally interested me. I asked what sort of sermons Mr. Mirabel
      preached. Lady Janeaway said: 'Come up to our room after dinner. The
      subject is too distressing to be discussed in public.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She began by making me personally acquainted with the reverend gentleman&mdash;that
      is to say, she showed me the photographic portraits of him. They were two
      in number. One only presented his face. The other exhibited him at full
      length, adorned in his surplice. Every lady in the congregation had
      received the two photographs as a farewell present. 'My portraits,' Lady
      Doris remarked, 'are the only complete specimens. The others have been
      irretrievably ruined by tears.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will now expect a personal description of this fascinating man. What
      the photographs failed to tell me, my friend was so kind as to complete
      from the resources of her own experience. Here is the result presented to
      the best of my ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is young&mdash;not yet thirty years of age. His complexion is fair;
      his features are delicate, his eyes are clear blue. He has pretty hands,
      and rings prettier still. And such a voice, and such manners! You will say
      there are plenty of pet parsons who answer to this description. Wait a
      little&mdash;I have kept his chief distinction till the last. His
      beautiful light hair flows in profusion over his shoulders; and his glossy
      beard waves, at apostolic length, down to the lower buttons of his
      waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of the Reverend Miles Mirabel now?
    </p>
    <p>
      "The life and adventures of our charming young clergyman, bear eloquent
      testimony to the saintly patience of his disposition, under trials which
      would have overwhelmed an ordinary man. (Lady Doris, please notice, quotes
      in this place the language of his admirers; and I report Lady Doris.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been clerk in a lawyer's office&mdash;unjustly dismissed. He has
      given readings from Shakespeare&mdash;infamously neglected. He has been
      secretary to a promenade concert company&mdash;deceived by a penniless
      manager. He has been employed in negotiations for making foreign railways&mdash;repudiated
      by an unprincipled Government. He has been translator to a publishing
      house&mdash;declared incapable by envious newspapers and reviews. He has
      taken refuge in dramatic criticism&mdash;dismissed by a corrupt editor.
      Through all these means of purification for the priestly career, he passed
      at last into the one sphere that was worthy of him: he entered the Church,
      under the protection of influential friends. Oh, happy change! From that
      moment his labors have been blessed. Twice already he has been presented
      with silver tea-pots filled with sovereigns. Go where he may, precious
      sympathies environ him; and domestic affection places his knife and fork
      at innumerable family tables. After a continental career, which will leave
      undying recollections, he is now recalled to England&mdash;at the
      suggestion of a person of distinction in the Church, who prefers a mild
      climate. It will now be his valued privilege to represent an absent rector
      in a country living; remote from cities, secluded in pastoral solitude,
      among simple breeders of sheep. May the shepherd prove worthy of the
      flock!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here again, my dear, I must give the merit where the merit is due. This
      memoir of Mr. Mirabel is not of my writing. It formed part of his farewell
      sermon, preserved in the memory of Lady Doris&mdash;and it shows (once
      more in the language of his admirers) that the truest humility may be
      found in the character of the most gifted man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me only add, that you will have opportunities of seeing and hearing
      this popular preacher, when circumstances permit him to address
      congregations in the large towns. I am at the end of my news; and I begin
      to feel&mdash;after this long, long letter&mdash;that it is time to go to
      bed. Need I say that I have often spoken of you to Doris, and that she
      entreats you to be her friend as well as mine, when we meet again in
      England?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, darling, for the present. With fondest love,

    <p>
      "Your CECILIA."
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S.&mdash;I have formed a new habit. In case of feeling hungry in the
      night, I keep a box of chocolate under the pillow. You have no idea what a
      comfort it is. If I ever meet with the man who fulfills my ideal, I shall
      make it a condition of the marriage settlement, that I am to have
      chocolate under the pillow."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. POLLY AND SALLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Without a care to trouble her; abroad or at home, finding inexhaustible
      varieties of amusement; seeing new places, making new acquaintances&mdash;what
      a disheartening contrast did Cecilia's happy life present to the life of
      her friend! Who, in Emily's position, could have read that
      joyously-written letter from Switzerland, and not have lost heart and
      faith, for the moment at least, as the inevitable result?
    </p>
    <p>
      A buoyant temperament is of all moral qualities the most precious, in this
      respect; it is the one force in us&mdash;when virtuous resolution proves
      insufficient&mdash;which resists by instinct the stealthy approaches of
      despair. "I shall only cry," Emily thought, "if I stay at home; better go
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Observant persons, accustomed to frequent the London parks, can hardly
      have failed to notice the number of solitary strangers sadly endeavoring
      to vary their lives by taking a walk. They linger about the flower-beds;
      they sit for hours on the benches; they look with patient curiosity at
      other people who have companions; they notice ladies on horseback and
      children at play, with submissive interest; some of the men find company
      in a pipe, without appearing to enjoy it; some of the women find a
      substitute for dinner, in little dry biscuits wrapped in crumpled scraps
      of paper; they are not sociable; they are hardly ever seen to make
      acquaintance with each other; perhaps they are shame-faced, or proud, or
      sullen; perhaps they despair of others, being accustomed to despair of
      themselves; perhaps they have their reasons for never venturing to
      encounter curiosity, or their vices which dread detection, or their
      virtues which suffer hardship with the resignation that is sufficient for
      itself. The one thing certain is, that these unfortunate people resist
      discovery. We know that they are strangers in London&mdash;and we know no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Emily was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the other forlorn wanderers in the Parks, there appeared latterly a
      trim little figure in black (with the face protected from notice behind a
      crape veil), which was beginning to be familiar, day after day, to
      nursemaids and children, and to rouse curiosity among harmless solitaries
      meditating on benches, and idle vagabonds strolling over the grass. The
      woman-servant, whom the considerate doctor had provided, was the one
      person in Emily's absence left to take care of the house. There was no
      other creature who could be a companion to the friendless girl. Mrs.
      Ellmother had never shown herself again since the funeral. Mrs. Mosey
      could not forget that she had been (no matter how politely) requested to
      withdraw. To whom could Emily say, "Let us go out for a walk?" She had
      communicated the news of her aunt's death to Miss Ladd, at Brighton; and
      had heard from Francine. The worthy schoolmistress had written to her with
      the truest kindness. "Choose your own time, my poor child, and come and
      stay with me at Brighton; the sooner the better." Emily shrank&mdash;not
      from accepting the invitation&mdash;but from encountering Francine. The
      hard West Indian heiress looked harder than ever with a pen in her hand.
      Her letter announced that she was "getting on wretchedly with her studies
      (which she hated); she found the masters appointed to instruct her ugly
      and disagreeable (and loathed the sight of them); she had taken a dislike
      to Miss Ladd (and time only confirmed that unfavorable impression);
      Brighton was always the same; the sea was always the same; the drives were
      always the same. Francine felt a presentiment that she should do something
      desperate, unless Emily joined her, and made Brighton endurable behind the
      horrid schoolmistress's back." Solitude in London was a privilege and a
      pleasure, viewed as the alternative to such companionship as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily wrote gratefully to Miss Ladd, and asked to be excused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other days had passed drearily since that time; but the one day that had
      brought with it Cecilia's letter set past happiness and present sorrow
      together so vividly and so cruelly that Emily's courage sank. She had
      forced back the tears, in her lonely home; she had gone out to seek
      consolation and encouragement under the sunny sky&mdash;to find comfort
      for her sore heart in the radiant summer beauty of flowers and grass, in
      the sweet breathing of the air, in the happy heavenward soaring of the
      birds. No! Mother Nature is stepmother to the sick at heart. Soon, too
      soon, she could hardly see where she went. Again and again she resolutely
      cleared her eyes, under the shelter of her veil, when passing strangers
      noticed her; and again and again the tears found their way back. Oh, if
      the girls at the school were to see her now&mdash;the girls who used to
      say in their moments of sadness, "Let us go to Emily and be cheered"&mdash;would
      they know her again? She sat down to rest and recover herself on the
      nearest bench. It was unoccupied. No passing footsteps were audible on the
      remote path to which she had strayed. Solitude at home! Solitude in the
      Park! Where was Cecilia at that moment? In Italy, among the lake s and
      mountains, happy in the company of her light-hearted friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lonely interval passed, and persons came near. Two sisters, girls like
      herself, stopped to rest on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were full of their own interests; they hardly looked at the stranger
      in mourning garments. The younger sister was to be married, and the elder
      was to be bridesmaid. They talked of their dresses and their presents;
      they compared the dashing bridegroom of one with the timid lover of the
      other; they laughed over their own small sallies of wit, over their joyous
      dreams of the future, over their opinions of the guests invited to the
      wedding. Too joyfully restless to remain inactive any longer, they jumped
      up again from the seat. One of them said, "Polly, I'm too happy!" and
      danced as she walked away. The other cried, "Sally, for shame!" and
      laughed, as if she had hit on the most irresistible joke that ever was
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily rose and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some mysterious influence which she was unable to trace, the boisterous
      merriment of the two girls had roused in her a sense of revolt against the
      life that she was leading. Change, speedy change, to some occupation that
      would force her to exert herself, presented the one promise of brighter
      days that she could see. To feel this was to be inevitably reminded of Sir
      Jervis Redwood. Here was a man, who had never seen her, transformed by the
      incomprehensible operation of Chance into the friend of whom she stood in
      need&mdash;the friend who pointed the way to a new world of action, the
      busy world of readers in the library of the Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the new week, Emily had accepted Sir Jervis's proposal, and had
      so interested the bookseller to whom she had been directed to apply, that
      he took it on himself to modify the arbitrary instructions of his
      employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old gentleman has no mercy on himself, and no mercy on others," he
      explained, "where his literary labors are concerned. You must spare
      yourself, Miss Emily. It is not only absurd, it's cruel, to expect you to
      ransack old newspapers for discoveries in Yucatan, from the time when
      Stephens published his 'Travels in Central America'&mdash;nearly forty
      years since! Begin with back numbers published within a few years&mdash;say
      five years from the present date&mdash;and let us see what your search
      over that interval will bring forth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accepting this friendly advice, Emily began with the newspaper-volume
      dating from New Year's Day, 1876.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first hour of her search strengthened the sincere sense of gratitude
      with which she remembered the bookseller's kindness. To keep her attention
      steadily fixed on the one subject that interested her employer, and to
      resist the temptation to read those miscellaneous items of news which
      especially interest women, put her patience and resolution to a merciless
      test. Happily for herself, her neighbors on either side were no idlers. To
      see them so absorbed over their work that they never once looked at her,
      after the first moment when she took her place between them, was to find
      exactly the example of which she stood most in need. As the hours wore on,
      she pursued her weary way, down one column and up another, resigned at
      least (if not quite reconciled yet) to her task. Her labors ended, for the
      day, with such encouragement as she might derive from the conviction of
      having, thus far, honestly pursued a useless search.
    </p>
    <p>
      News was waiting for her when she reached home, which raised her sinking
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the cottage that morning she had given certain instructions,
      relating to the modest stranger who had taken charge of her correspondence&mdash;in
      case of his paying a second visit, during her absence at the Museum. The
      first words spoken by the servant, on opening the door, informed her that
      the unknown gentleman had called again. This time he had boldly left his
      card. There was the welcome name that she had expected to see&mdash;Alban
      Morris.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. ALBAN MORRIS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Having looked at the card, Emily put her first question to the servant.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Did you tell Mr. Morris what your orders were?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss; I said I was to have shown him in, if you had been at home.
      Perhaps I did wrong; I told him what you told me when you went out this
      morning&mdash;I said you had gone to read at the Museum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think you did wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, miss, he didn't say anything, but he looked upset."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that he looked angry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant shook her head. "Not exactly angry&mdash;puzzled and put out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he leave any message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said he would call later, if you would be so good as to receive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour more, Alban and Emily were together again. The light fell
      full on her face as she rose to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how you have suffered!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words escaped him before he could restrain himself. He looked at her
      with the tender sympathy, so precious to women, which she had not seen in
      the face of any human creature since the loss of her aunt. Even the good
      doctor's efforts to console her had been efforts of professional routine&mdash;the
      inevitable result of his life-long familiarity with sorrow and death.
      While Alban's eyes rested on her, Emily felt her tears rising. In the fear
      that he might misinterpret her reception of him, she made an effort to
      speak with some appearance of composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I lead a lonely life," she said; "and I can well understand that my face
      shows it. You are one of my very few friends, Mr. Morris"&mdash;the tears
      rose again; it discouraged her to see him standing irresolute, with his
      hat in his hand, fearful of intruding on her. "Indeed, indeed, you are
      welcome," she said, very earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those sad days her heart was easily touched. She gave him her hand for
      the second time. He held it gently for a moment. Every day since they had
      parted she had been in his thoughts; she had become dearer to him than
      ever. He was too deeply affected to trust himself to answer. That silence
      pleaded for him as nothing had pleaded for him yet. In her secret self she
      remembered with wonder how she had received his confession in the school
      garden. It was a little hard on him, surely, to have forbidden him even to
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of her own weakness&mdash;even while giving way to it&mdash;she
      felt the necessity of turning his attention from herself. In some
      confusion, she pointed to a chair at her side, and spoke of his first
      visit, when he had left her letters at the door. Having confided to him
      all that she had discovered, and all that she had guessed, on that
      occasion, it was by an easy transition that she alluded next to the motive
      for his journey to the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought it might be suspicion of Mrs. Rook," she said. "Was I
      mistaken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; you were right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were serious suspicions, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly! I should not otherwise have devoted my holiday-time to
      clearing them up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I know what they were?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to disappoint you," he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you would rather not answer my question," she interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather hear you tell me if you have made any other guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One more, Mr. Morris. I guessed that you had become acquainted with Sir
      Jervis Redwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the second time, Miss Emily, you have arrived at a sound conclusion.
      My one hope of finding opportunities for observing Sir Jervis's
      housekeeper depended on my chance of gaining admission to Sir Jervis's
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you succeed? Perhaps you provided yourself with a letter of
      introduction?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew nobody who could introduce me," Alban replied. "As the event
      proved, a letter would have been needless. Sir Jervis introduced himself&mdash;and,
      more wonderful still, he invited me to his house at our first interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Jervis introduced himself?" Emily repeated, in amazement. "From
      Cecilia's description of him, I should have thought he was the last person
      in the world to do that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban smiled. "And you would like to know how it happened?" he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very favor I was going to ask of you," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of at once complying with her wishes, he paused&mdash;hesitated&mdash;and
      made a strange request. "Will you forgive my rudeness, if I ask leave to
      walk up and down the room while I talk? I am a restless man. Walking up
      and down helps me to express myself freely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her f ace brightened for the first time. "How like You that is!" she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban looked at her with surprise and delight. She had betrayed an
      interest in studying his character, which he appreciated at its full
      value. "I should never have dared to hope," he said, "that you knew me so
      well already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are forgetting your story," she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to the opposite side of the room, where there were fewer
      impediments in the shape of furniture. With his head down, and his hands
      crossed behind him, he paced to and fro. Habit made him express himself in
      his usual quaint way&mdash;but he became embarrassed as he went on. Was he
      disturbed by his recollections? or by the fear of taking Emily into his
      confidence too freely?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Different people have different ways of telling a story," he said. "Mine
      is the methodical way&mdash;I begin at the beginning. We will start, if
      you please, in the railway&mdash;we will proceed in a one-horse chaise&mdash;and
      we will stop at a village, situated in a hole. It was the nearest place to
      Sir Jervis's house, and it was therefore my destination. I picked out the
      biggest of the cottages&mdash;I mean the huts&mdash;and asked the woman at
      the door if she had a bed to let. She evidently thought me either mad or
      drunk. I wasted no time in persuasion; the right person to plead my cause
      was asleep in her arms. I began by admiring the baby; and I ended by
      taking the baby's portrait. From that moment I became a member of the
      family&mdash;the member who had his own way. Besides the room occupied by
      the husband and wife, there was a sort of kennel in which the husband's
      brother slept. He was dismissed (with five shillings of mine to comfort
      him) to find shelter somewhere else; and I was promoted to the vacant
      place. It is my misfortune to be tall. When I went to bed, I slept with my
      head on the pillow, and my feet out of the window. Very cool and pleasant
      in summer weather. The next morning, I set my trap for Sir Jervis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your trap?" Emily repeated, wondering what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went out to sketch from Nature," Alban continued. "Can anybody (with or
      without a title, I don't care), living in a lonely country house, see a
      stranger hard at work with a color-box and brushes, and not stop to look
      at what he is doing? Three days passed, and nothing happened. I was quite
      patient; the grand open country all round me offered lessons of
      inestimable value in what we call aerial perspective. On the fourth day, I
      was absorbed over the hardest of all hard tasks in landscape art, studying
      the clouds straight from Nature. The magnificent moorland silence was
      suddenly profaned by a man's voice, speaking (or rather croaking) behind
      me. 'The worst curse of human life,' the voice said, 'is the detestable
      necessity of taking exercise. I hate losing my time; I hate fine scenery;
      I hate fresh air; I hate a pony. Go on, you brute!' Being too deeply
      engaged with the clouds to look round, I had supposed this pretty speech
      to be addressed to some second person. Nothing of the sort; the croaking
      voice had a habit of speaking to itself. In a minute more, there came
      within my range of view a solitary old man, mounted on a rough pony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it Sir Jervis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looked more like the popular notion of the devil," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Morris!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you my first impression, Miss Emily, for what it is worth. He had
      his high-peaked hat in his hand, to keep his head cool. His wiry iron-gray
      hair looked like hair standing on end; his bushy eyebrows curled upward
      toward his narrow temples; his horrid old globular eyes stared with a
      wicked brightness; his pointed beard hid his chin; he was covered from his
      throat to his ankles in a loose black garment, something between a coat
      and a cloak; and, to complete him, he had a club foot. I don't doubt that
      Sir Jervis Redwood is the earthly alias which he finds convenient&mdash;but
      I stick to that first impression which appeared to surprise you. 'Ha! an
      artist; you seem to be the sort of man I want!' In those terms he
      introduced himself. Observe, if you please, that my trap caught him the
      moment he came my way. Who wouldn't be an artist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he take a liking to you?" Emily inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not he! I don't believe he ever took a liking to anybody in his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how did you get your invitation to his house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the amusing part of it, Miss Emily. Give me a little breathing
      time, and you shall hear."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. MISS REDWOOD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I got invited to Sir Jervis's house," Alban resumed, "by treating the old
      savage as unceremoniously as he had treated me. 'That's an idle trade of
      yours,' he said, looking at my sketch. 'Other ignorant people have made
      the same remark,' I answered. He rode away, as if he was not used to be
      spoken to in that manner, and then thought better of it, and came back.
      'Do you understand wood engraving?' he asked. 'Yes.' 'And etching?' 'I
      have practiced etching myself.' 'Are you a Royal Academician?' 'I'm a
      drawing-master at a ladies' school.' 'Whose school?' 'Miss Ladd's.' 'Damn
      it, you know the girl who ought to have been my secretary.' I am not quite
      sure whether you will take it as a compliment&mdash;Sir Jervis appeared to
      view you in the light of a reference to my respectability. At any rate, he
      went on with his questions. 'How long do you stop in these parts?' 'I
      haven't made up my mind.' 'Look here; I want to consult you&mdash;are you
      listening?' 'No; I'm sketching.' He burst into a horrid scream. I asked if
      he felt himself taken ill. 'Ill?' he said&mdash;'I'm laughing.' It was a
      diabolical laugh, in one syllable&mdash;not 'ha! ha! ha!' only 'ha!'&mdash;and
      it made him look wonderfully like that eminent person, whom I persist in
      thinking he resembles. 'You're an impudent dog,' he said; 'where are you
      living?' He was so delighted when he heard of my uncomfortable position in
      the kennel-bedroom, that he offered his hospitality on the spot. 'I can't
      go to you in such a pigstye as that,' he said; 'you must come to me.
      What's your name?' 'Alban Morris; what's yours?' 'Jervis Redwood. Pack up
      your traps when you've done your job, and come and try my kennel. There it
      is, in a corner of your drawing, and devilish like, too.' I packed up my
      traps, and I tried his kennel. And now you have had enough of Sir Jervis
      Redwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not half enough!" Emily answered. "Your story leaves off just at the
      interesting moment. I want you to take me to Sir Jervis's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I want you, Miss Emily, to take me to the British Museum. Don't let
      me startle you! When I called here earlier in the day, I was told that you
      had gone to the reading-room. Is your reading a secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner, when he made that reply, suggested to Emily that there was
      some foregone conclusion in his mind, which he was putting to the test.
      She answered without alluding to the impression which he had produced on
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My reading is no secret. I am only consulting old newspapers."
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated the last words to himself. "Old newspapers?" he said&mdash;as
      if he was not quite sure of having rightly understood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to help him by a more definite reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am looking through old newspapers," she resumed, "beginning with the
      year eighteen hundred and seventy-six."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And going back from that time," he asked eagerly; "to earlier dates
      still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;just the contrary&mdash;advancing from 'seventy-six' to the
      present time."
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly turned pale&mdash;and tried to hide his face from her by
      looking out of the window. For a moment, his agitation deprived him of his
      presence of mind. In that moment, she saw that she had alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I said to frighten you?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to assume a tone of commonplace gallantry. "There are limits even
      to your power over me," he replied. "Whatever else you may do, you can
      never frighten me. Are you searching those old newspapers with any
      particular object in view?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I know what it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I know why I frightened you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to walk up and down the room again&mdash;then checked himself
      abruptly, and appealed to her mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be hard on me," he pleaded. "I am so fond of you&mdash;oh, forgive
      me! I only mean that it distresses me to have any concealments from you.
      If I could open my whole heart at this moment, I should be a happier man."
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood him and believed him. "My curiosity shall never embarrass
      you again," she answered warmly. "I won't even remember that I wanted to
      hear how you got on in Sir Jervis's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      His gratitude seized the opportunity of taking her harmlessly into his
      confidence. "As Sir Jervis's guest," he said, "my experience is at your
      service. Only tell me how I can interest you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, with some hesitation, "I should like to know what happened
      when you first saw Mrs. Rook." To her surprise and relief, he at once
      complied with her wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We met," he said, "on the evening when I first entered the house. Sir
      Jervis took me into the dining-room&mdash;and there sat Miss Redwood, with
      a large black cat on her lap. Older than her brother, taller than her
      brother, leaner than her brother&mdash;with strange stony eyes, and a skin
      like parchment&mdash;she looked (if I may speak in contradictions) like a
      living corpse. I was presented, and the corpse revived. The last lingering
      relics of former good breeding showed themselves faintly in her brow and
      in her smile. You will hear more of Miss Redwood presently. In the
      meanwhile, Sir Jervis made me reward his hospitality by professional
      advice. He wished me to decide whether the artists whom he had employed to
      illustrate his wonderful book had cheated him by overcharges and bad work&mdash;and
      Mrs. Rook was sent to fetch the engravings from his study upstairs. You
      remember her petrified appearance, when she first read the inscription on
      your locket? The same result followed when she found herself face to face
      with me. I saluted her civilly&mdash;she was deaf and blind to my
      politeness. Her master snatched the illustrations out of her hand, and
      told her to leave the room. She stood stockstill, staring helplessly. Sir
      Jervis looked round at his sister; and I followed his example. Miss
      Redwood was observing the housekeeper too attentively to notice anything
      else; her brother was obliged to speak to her. 'Try Rook with the bell,'
      he said. Miss Redwood took a fine old bronze hand-bell from the table at
      her side, and rang it. At the shrill silvery sound of the bell, Mrs. Rook
      put her hand to her head as if the ringing had hurt her&mdash;turned
      instantly, and left us. 'Nobody can manage Rook but my sister,' Sir Jervis
      explained; 'Rook is crazy.' Miss Redwood differed with him. 'No!' she
      said. Only one word, but there were volumes of contradiction in it. Sir
      Jervis looked at me slyly; meaning, perhaps, that he thought his sister
      crazy too. The dinner was brought in at the same moment, and my attention
      was diverted to Mrs. Rook's husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was he like?" Emily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really can't tell you; he was one of those essentially commonplace
      persons, whom one never looks at a second time. His dress was shabby, his
      head was bald, and his hands shook when he waited on us at table&mdash;and
      that is all I remember. Sir Jervis and I feasted on salt fish, mutton, and
      beer. Miss Redwood had cold broth, with a wine-glass full of rum poured
      into it by Mr. Rook. 'She's got no stomach,' her brother informed me; 'hot
      things come up again ten minutes after they have gone down her throat; she
      lives on that beastly mixture, and calls it broth-grog!' Miss Redwood
      sipped her elixir of life, and occasionally looked at me with an
      appearance of interest which I was at a loss to understand. Dinner being
      over, she rang her antique bell. The shabby old man-servant answered her
      call. 'Where's your wife?' she inquired. 'Ill, miss.' She took Mr. Rook's
      arm to go out, and stopped as she passed me. 'Come to my room, if you
      please, sir, to-morrow at two o'clock,' she said. Sir Jervis explained
      again: 'She's all to pieces in the morning' (he invariably called his
      sister 'She'); 'and gets patched up toward the middle of the day. Death
      has forgotten her, that's about the truth of it.' He lighted his pipe and
      pondered over the hieroglyphics found among the ruined cities of Yucatan;
      I lighted my pipe, and read the only book I could find in the dining-room&mdash;a
      dreadful record of shipwrecks and disasters at sea. When the room was full
      of tobacco-smoke we fell asleep in our chairs&mdash;and when we awoke
      again we got up and went to bed. There is the true story of my first
      evening at Redwood Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily begged him to go on. "You have interested me in Miss Redwood," she
      said. "You kept your appointment, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I kept my appointment in no very pleasant humor. Encouraged by my
      favorable report of the illustrations which he had submitted to my
      judgment, Sir Jervis proposed to make me useful to him in a new capacity.
      'You have nothing particular to do,' he said, 'suppose you clean my
      pictures?' I gave him one of my black looks, and made no other reply. My
      interview with his sister tried my powers of self-command in another way.
      Miss Redwood declared her purpose in sending for me the moment I entered
      the room. Without any preliminary remarks&mdash;speaking slowly and
      emphatically, in a wonderfully strong voice for a woman of her age&mdash;she
      said, 'I have a favor to ask of you, sir. I want you to tell me what Mrs.
      Rook has done.' I was so staggered that I stared at her like a fool. She
      went on: 'I suspected Mrs. Rook, sir, of having guilty remembrances on her
      conscience before she had been a week in our service.' Can you imagine my
      astonishment when I heard that Miss Redwood's view of Mrs. Rook was my
      view? Finding that I still said nothing, the old lady entered into
      details: 'We arranged, sir,' (she persisted in calling me 'sir,' with the
      formal politeness of the old school)&mdash;'we arranged, sir, that Mrs.
      Rook and her husband should occupy the bedroom next to mine, so that I
      might have her near me in case of my being taken ill in the night. She
      looked at the door between the two rooms&mdash;suspicious! She asked if
      there was any objection to her changing to another room&mdash;suspicious!
      suspicious! Pray take a seat, sir, and tell me which Mrs. Rook is guilty
      of&mdash;theft or murder?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dreadful old woman!" Emily exclaimed. "How did you answer her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told her, with perfect truth, that I knew nothing of Mrs. Rook's
      secrets. Miss Redwood's humor took a satirical turn. 'Allow me to ask,
      sir, whether your eyes were shut, when our housekeeper found herself
      unexpectedly in your presence?' I referred the old lady to her brother's
      opinion. 'Sir Jervis believes Mrs. Rook to be crazy,' I reminded her. 'Do
      you refuse to trust me, sir?' 'I have no information to give you, madam.'
      She waved her skinny old hand in the direction of the door. I made my bow,
      and retired. She called me back. 'Old women used to be prophets, sir, in
      the bygone time,' she said. 'I will venture on a prediction. You will be
      the means of depriving us of the services of Mr. and Mrs. Rook. If you
      will be so good as to stay here a day or two longer you will hear that
      those two people have given us notice to quit. It will be her doing, mind&mdash;he
      is a mere cypher. I wish you good-morning.' Will you believe me, when I
      tell you that the prophecy was fulfilled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that they actually left the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They would certainly have left the house," Alban answered, "if Sir Jervis
      had not insisted on receiving the customary month's warning. He asserted
      his resolution by locking up the old husband in the pantry. His sister's
      suspicions never entered his head; the housekeeper's conduct (he said)
      simply proved that she was, what he had always considered her to be,
      crazy. 'A capital servant, in spite of that drawback,' he remarked; 'and
      you will see, I shall bring her to her senses.' The impression produced on
      me was naturally of a very different kind. While I was still uncertain how
      to entrap Mrs. Rook into confirming my suspicions, she herself had saved
      me the trouble. She had placed her own guilty interpretation on my
      appearance in the house&mdash;I had driven her away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily remained true to her resolution not to let her curiosity embarrass
      Alban again. But the unexpressed question was in her thoughts&mdash;"Of
      what guilt does he suspect Mrs. Rook? And, when he first felt his
      suspicions, was my father in his mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had only to consider next, whether I could hope to make any further
      discoveries, if I continued to be Sir Jervis's guest. The object of my
      journey had been gained; and I had no desire to be employed as
      picture-cleaner. Miss Redwood assisted me in arriving at a decision. I was
      sent for to speak to her again. The success of her prophecy had raised her
      spirits. She asked, with ironical humility, if I proposed to honor them by
      still remaining their guest, after the disturbance that I had provoked. I
      answered that I proposed to leave by the first train the next morning.
      'Will it be convenient for you to travel to some place at a good distance
      from this part of the world?' she asked. I had my own reasons for going to
      London, and said so. 'Will you mention that to my brother this evening,
      just before we sit down to dinner?' she continued. 'And will you tell him
      plainly that you have no intention of returning to the North? I shall make
      use of Mrs. Rook's arm, as usual, to help me downstairs&mdash;and I will
      take care that she hears what you say. Without venturing on another
      prophecy, I will only hint to you that I have my own idea of what will
      happen; and I should like you to see for yourself, sir, whether my
      anticipations are realized.' Need I tell you that this strange old woman
      proved to be right once more? Mr. Rook was released; Mrs. Rook made humble
      apologies, and laid the whole blame on her husband's temper: and Sir
      Jervis bade me remark that his method had succeeded in bringing the
      housekeeper to her senses. Such were the results produced by the
      announcement of my departure for London&mdash;purposely made in Mrs.
      Rook's hearing. Do you agree with me, that my journey to Northumberland
      has not been taken in vain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, Emily felt the necessity of controlling herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban had said that he had "reasons of his own for going to London." Could
      she venture to ask him what those reasons were? She could only persist in
      restraining her curiosity, and conclude that he would have mentioned his
      motive, if it had been (as she had at one time supposed) connected with
      herself. It was a wise decision. No earthly consideration would have
      induced Alban to answer her, if she had put the question to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All doubt of the correctness of his own first impression was now at an
      end; he was convinced that Mrs. Rook had been an accomplice in the crime
      committed, in 1877, at the village inn. His object in traveling to London
      was to consult the newspaper narrative of the murder. He, too, had been
      one of the readers at the Museum&mdash;had examined the back numbers of
      the newspaper&mdash;and had arrived at the conclusion that Emily's father
      had been the victim of the crime. Unless he found means to prevent it, her
      course of reading would take her from the year 1876 to the year 1877, and
      under that date, she would see the fatal report, heading the top of a
      column, and printed in conspicuous type.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile Emily had broken the silence, before it could lead to
      embarrassing results, by asking if Alban had seen Mrs. Rook again, on the
      morning when he left Sir Jervis's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was nothing to be gained by seeing her," Alban replied. "Now that
      she and her husband had decided to remain at Redwood Hall, I knew where to
      find her in case of necessity. As it happened I saw nobody, on the morning
      of my departure, but Sir Jervis himself. He still held to his idea of
      having his pictures cleaned for nothing. 'If you can't do it yourself,' he
      said, 'couldn't you teach my secretary?' He described the lady whom he had
      engaged in your place as a 'nasty middle-aged woman with a perpetual cold
      in her head.' At the same time (he remarked) he was a friend to the women,
      'because he got them cheap.' I declined to teach the unfortunate secretary
      the art of picture-cleaning. Finding me determined, Sir Jervis was quite
      ready to say good-by. But he made use of me to the last. He employed me as
      postman and saved a stamp. The letter addressed to you arrived at
      breakfast-time. Sir Jervis said, 'You are going to London; suppose you
      take it with you?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he tell you that there was a letter of his own inclosed in the
      envelope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. When he gave me the envelope it was already sealed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily at once handed to him Sir Jervis's letter. "That will tell you who
      employs me at the Museum, and what my work is," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked through the letter, and at once offered&mdash;eagerly offered&mdash;to
      help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been a student in the reading-room at intervals, for years past,"
      he said. "Let me assist you, and I shall have something to do in my
      holiday time." He was so anxious to be of use that he interrupted her
      before she could thank him. "Let us take alternate years," he suggested.
      "Did you not tell me you were searching the newspapers published in
      eighteen hundred and seventy-six?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. I will take the next year. You will take the year after. And
      so on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind," she answered&mdash;"but I should like to propose an
      improvement on your plan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What improvement?" he asked, rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will leave the five years, from 'seventy-six to 'eighty-one,
      entirely to me," she resumed, "and take the next five years, reckoning <i>backward</i>
      from 'seventy-six, you will help me to better purpose. Sir Jervis expects
      me to look for reports of Central American Explorations, through the
      newspapers of the last forty years; and I have taken the liberty of
      limiting the heavy task imposed on me. When I report my progress to my
      employer, I should like to say that I have got through ten years of the
      examination, instead of five. Do you see any objection to the arrangement
      I propose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He proved to be obstinate&mdash;incomprehensibly obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us try my plan to begin with," he insisted. "While you are looking
      through 'seventy-six, let me be at work on 'seventy-seven. If you still
      prefer your own arrangement, after that, I will follow your suggestion
      with pleasure. Is it agreed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her acute perception&mdash;enlightened by his tone as wall as by his words&mdash;detected
      something under the surface already.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't agreed until I understand you a little better," she quietly
      replied. "I fancy you have some object of your own in view."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with her usual directness of look and manner. He was evidently
      disconcerted. "What makes you think so?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own experience of myself makes me think so," she answered. "If <i>I</i>
      had some object to gain, I should persist in carrying it out&mdash;like
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does that mean, Miss Emily, that you refuse to give way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. Morris. I have made myself disagreeable, but I know when to stop.
      I trust you&mdash;and submit."
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been less deeply interested in the accomplishment of his
      merciful design, he might have viewed Emily's sudden submission with some
      distrust. As it was, his eagerness to prevent her from discovering the
      narrative of the murder hurried him into an act of indiscretion. He made
      an excuse to leave her immediately, in the fear that she might change her
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have inexcusably prolonged my visit," he said. "If I presume on your
      kindness in this way, how can I hope that you will receive me again? We
      meet to-morrow in the reading-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened away, as if he was afraid to let her say a word in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there something he doesn't want me to see, in the news of the year
      'seventy-seven?" The one explanation which suggested itself to her mind
      assumed that form of expression&mdash;and the one method of satisfying her
      curiosity that seemed likely to succeed, was to search the volume which
      Alban had reserved for his own reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days they pursued their task together, seated at opposite desks.
      On the third day Emily was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at the library in the City, consulting the file of <i>The Times</i>
      for the year 1877.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. MR. ROOK.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Emily's first day in the City library proved to be a day wasted.
    </h3>
    <p>
      She began reading the back numbers of the newspaper at haphazard, without
      any definite idea of what she was looking for. Conscious of the error into
      which her own impatience had led her, she was at a loss how to retrace the
      false step that she had taken. But two alternatives presented themselves:
      either to abandon the hope of making any discovery&mdash;or to attempt to
      penetrate Alban 's motives by means of pure guesswork, pursued in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was the problem to be solved? This serious question troubled her all
      through the evening, and kept her awake when she went to bed. In despair
      of her capacity to remove the obstacle that stood in her way, she decided
      on resuming her regular work at the Museum&mdash;turned her pillow to get
      at the cool side of it&mdash;and made up her mind to go asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of the wiser animals, the Person submits to Sleep. It is only
      the superior human being who tries the hopeless experiment of making Sleep
      submit to the Person. Wakeful on the warm side of the pillow, Emily
      remained wakeful on the cool side&mdash;thinking again and again of the
      interview with Alban which had ended so strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, her mind passed the limits which had restrained it thus
      far. Alban's conduct in keeping his secret, in the matter of the
      newspapers, now began to associate itself with Alban's conduct in keeping
      that other secret, which concealed from her his suspicions of Mrs. Rook.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started up in bed as the next possibility occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In speaking of the disaster which had compelled Mr. and Mrs. Rook to close
      the inn, Cecilia had alluded to an inquest held on the body of the
      murdered man. Had the inquest been mentioned in the newspapers, at the
      time? And had Alban seen something in the report, which concerned Mrs.
      Rook?
    </p>
    <p>
      Led by the new light that had fallen on her, Emily returned to the library
      the next morning with a definite idea of what she had to look for.
      Incapable of giving exact dates, Cecilia had informed her that the crime
      was committed "in the autumn." The month to choose, in beginning her
      examination, was therefore the month of August.
    </p>
    <p>
      No discovery rewarded her. She tried September, next&mdash;with the same
      unsatisfactory results. On Monday the first of October she met with some
      encouragement at last. At the top of a column appeared a telegraphic
      summary of all that was then known of the crime. In the number for the
      Wednesday following, she found a full report of the proceedings at the
      inquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing over the preliminary remarks, Emily read the evidence with the
      closest attention.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
</pre>
    <p>
      The jury having viewed the body, and having visited an outhouse in which
      the murder had been committed, the first witness called was Mr. Benjamin
      Rook, landlord of the Hand-in-Hand inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of Sunday, September 30th, 1877, two gentlemen presented
      themselves at Mr. Rook's house, under circumstances which especially
      excited his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest of the two was short, and of fair complexion. He carried a
      knapsack, like a gentleman on a pedestrian excursion; his manners were
      pleasant; and he was decidedly good-looking. His companion, older, taller,
      and darker&mdash;and a finer man altogether&mdash;leaned on his arm and
      seemed to be exhausted. In every respect they were singularly unlike each
      other. The younger stranger (excepting little half-whiskers) was clean
      shaved. The elder wore his whole beard. Not knowing their names, the
      landlord distinguished them, at the coroner's suggestion, as the fair
      gentleman, and the dark gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was raining when the two arrived at the inn. There were signs in the
      heavens of a stormy night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On accosting the landlord, the fair gentleman volunteered the following
      statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the village, he had been startled by seeing the dark gentleman
      (a total stranger to him) stretched prostrate on the grass at the roadside&mdash;so
      far as he could judge, in a swoon. Having a flask with brandy in it, he
      revived the fainting man, and led him to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This statement was confirmed by a laborer, who was on his way to the
      village at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark gentleman endeavored to explain what had happened to him. He had,
      as he supposed, allowed too long a time to pass (after an early breakfast
      that morning), without taking food: he could only attribute the fainting
      fit to that cause. He was not liable to fainting fits. What purpose (if
      any) had brought him into the neighborhood of Zeeland, he did not state.
      He had no intention of remaining at the inn, except for refreshment; and
      he asked for a carriage to take him to the railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair gentleman, seeing the signs of bad weather, desired to remain in
      Mr. Rook's house for the night, and proposed to resume his walking tour
      the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excepting the case of supper, which could be easily provided, the landlord
      had no choice but to disappoint both his guests. In his small way of
      business, none of his customers wanted to hire a carriage&mdash;even if he
      could have afforded to keep one. As for beds, the few rooms which the inn
      contained were all engaged; including even the room occupied by himself
      and his wife. An exhibition of agricultural implements had been opened in
      the neighborhood, only two days since; and a public competition between
      rival machines was to be decided on the coming Monday. Not only was the
      Hand-in-Hand inn crowded, but even the accommodation offered by the
      nearest town had proved barely sufficient to meet the public demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen looked at each other and agreed that there was no help for
      it but to hurry the supper, and walk to the railway station&mdash;a
      distance of between five and six miles&mdash;in time to catch the last
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the meal was being prepared, the rain held off for a while. The dark
      man asked his way to the post-office and went out by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back in about ten minutes, and sat down afterward to supper with
      his companion. Neither the landlord, nor any other person in the public
      room, noticed any change in him on his return. He was a grave, quiet sort
      of person, and (unlike the other one) not much of a talker.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the darkness came on, the rain fell again heavily; and the heavens were
      black.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flash of lightning startled the gentlemen when they went to the window
      to look out: the thunderstorm began. It was simply impossible that two
      strangers to the neighborhood could find their way to the station, through
      storm and darkness, in time to catch the train. With or without bedrooms,
      they must remain at the inn for the night. Having already given up their
      own room to their lodgers, the landlord and landlady had no other place to
      sleep in than the kitchen. Next to the kitchen, and communicating with it
      by a door, was an outhouse; used, partly as a scullery, partly as a
      lumber-room. There was an old truckle-bed among the lumber, on which one
      of the gentlemen might rest. A mattress on the floor could be provided for
      the other. After adding a table and a basin, for the purposes of the
      toilet, the accommodation which Mr. Rook was able to offer came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travelers agreed to occupy this makeshift bed-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thunderstorm passed away; but the rain continued to fall heavily. Soon
      after eleven the guests at the inn retired for the night. There was some
      little discussion between the two travelers, as to which of them should
      take possession of the truckle-bed. It was put an end to by the fair
      gentleman, in his own pleasant way. He proposed to "toss up for it"&mdash;and
      he lost. The dark gentleman went to bed first; the fair gentleman
      followed, after waiting a while. Mr. Rook took his knapsack into the
      outhouse; and arranged on the table his appliances for the toilet&mdash;contained
      in a leather roll, and including a razor&mdash;ready for use in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having previously barred the second door of the outhouse, which led into
      the yard, Mr. Rook fastened the other door, the lock and bolts of which
      were on the side of the kitchen. He then secured the house door, and the
      shutters over the lower windows. Returning to the kitchen, he noticed that
      the time was ten minutes short of midnight. Soon afterward, he and his
      wife went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened to disturb Mr. and Mrs. Rook during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter to seven the next morning, he got up; his wife being still
      asleep. He had been instructed to wake the gentlemen early; and he knocked
      at their door. Receiving no answer, after repeatedly knocking, he opened
      the door and stepped into the outhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point in his evidence, the witness's recollections appeared to
      overpower him. "Give me a moment, gentlemen," he said to the jury. "I have
      had a dreadful fright; and I don't believe I shall get over it for the
      rest of my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      The coroner helped him by a question: "What did you see when you opened
      the door?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rook answered: "I saw the dark man stretched out on his bed&mdash;dead,
      with a frightful wound in his throat. I saw an open razor, stained with
      smears of blood, at his side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you notice the door, leading into the yard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was wide open, sir. When I was able to look round me, the other
      traveler&mdash;I mean the man with the fair complexion, who carried the
      knapsack&mdash;was nowhere to be seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do, after making these discoveries?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I closed the yard door. Then I locked the other door, and put the key in
      my pocket. After that I roused the servant, and sent him to the constable&mdash;who
      lived near to us&mdash;while I ran for the doctor, whose house was at the
      other end of our village. The doctor sent his groom, on horseback, to the
      police-office in the town. When I returned to the inn, the constable was
      there&mdash;and he and the police took the matter into their own hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have nothing more to tell us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing more."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. "J. B."
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Rook having completed his evidence, the police authorities were the
      next witnesses examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not found the slightest trace of any attempt to break into the
      house in the night. The murdered man's gold watch and chain were
      discovered under his pillow. On examining his clothes the money was found
      in his purse, and the gold studs and sleeve buttons were left in his
      shirt. But his pocketbook (seen by witnesses who had not yet been
      examined) was missing. The search for visiting cards and letters had
      proved to be fruitless. Only the initials, "J. B.," were marked on his
      linen. He had brought no luggage with him to the inn. Nothing could be
      found which led to the discovery of his name or of the purpose which had
      taken him into that part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police examined the outhouse next, in search of circumstantial
      evidence against the missing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have carried away his knapsack, when he took to flight, but he had
      been (probably) in too great a hurry to look for his razor&mdash;or
      perhaps too terrified to touch it, if it had attracted his notice. The
      leather roll, and the other articles used for his toilet, had been taken
      away. Mr. Rook identified the blood-stained razor. He had noticed
      overnight the name of the Belgian city, "Liege," engraved on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yard was the next place inspected. Foot-steps were found on the muddy
      earth up to the wall. But the road on the other side had been recently
      mended with stones, and the trace of the fugitive was lost. Casts had been
      taken of the footsteps; and no other means of discovery had been left
      untried. The authorities in London had also been communicated with by
      telegraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor being called, described a personal peculiarity, which he had
      noticed at the post-mortem examination, and which might lead to the
      identification of the murdered man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the cause of death, the witness said it could be stated in two
      words. The internal jugular vein had been cut through, with such violence,
      judging by the appearances, that the wound could not have been inflicted,
      in the act of suicide, by the hand of the deceased person. No other
      injuries, and no sign of disease, was found on the body. The one cause of
      death had been Hemorrhage; and the one peculiarity which called for notice
      had been discovered in the mouth. Two of the front teeth, in the upper
      jaw, were false. They had been so admirably made to resemble the natural
      teeth on either side of them, in form and color, that the witness had only
      hit on the discovery by accidentally touching the inner side of the gum
      with one of his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady was examined, when the doctor had retired. Mrs. Rook was
      able, in answering questions put to her, to give important information, in
      reference to the missing pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before retiring to rest, the two gentlemen had paid the bill&mdash;intending
      to leave the inn the first thing in the morning. The traveler with the
      knapsack paid his share in money. The other unfortunate gentleman looked
      into his purse, and found only a shilling and a sixpence in it. He asked
      Mrs. Rook if she could change a bank-note. She told him it could be done,
      provided the note was for no considerable sum of money. Upon that he
      opened his pocketbook (which the witness described minutely) and turned
      out the contents on the table. After searching among many Bank of England
      notes, some in one pocket of the book and some in another, he found a note
      of the value of five pounds. He thereupon settled his bill, and received
      the change from Mrs. Rook&mdash;her husband being in another part of the
      room, attending to the guests. She noticed a letter in an envelope, and a
      few cards which looked (to her judgment) like visiting cards, among the
      bank-notes which he had turned out on the table. When she returned to him
      with the change, he had just put them back, and was closing the
      pocketbook. She saw him place it in one of the breast pockets of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow-traveler who had accompanied him to the inn was present all the
      time, sitting on the opposite side of the table. He made a remark when he
      saw the notes produced. He said, "Put all that money back&mdash;don't
      tempt a poor man like me!" It was said laughing, as if by way of a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook had observed nothing more that night; had slept as soundly as
      usual; and had been awakened when her husband knocked at the outhouse
      door, according to instructions received from the gentlemen, overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of the guests in the public room corroborated Mrs. Rook's evidence.
      They were respectable persons, well and widely known in that part of
      Hampshire. Besides these, there were two strangers staying in the house.
      They referred the coroner to their employers&mdash;eminent manufacturers
      at Sheffield and Wolverhampton&mdash;whose testimony spoke for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last witness called was a grocer in the village, who kept the
      post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 30th, a dark gentleman, wearing his beard, knocked
      at the door, and asked for a letter addressed to "J. B., Post-office,
      Zeeland." The letter had arrived by that morning's post; but, being Sunday
      evening, the grocer requested that application might be made for it the
      next morning. The stranger said the letter contained news, which it was of
      importance to him to receive without delay. Upon this, the grocer made an
      exception to customary rules and gave him the letter. He read it by the
      light of the lamp in the passage. It must have been short, for the reading
      was done in a moment. He seemed to think over it for a while; and then he
      turned round to go out. There was nothing to notice in his look or in his
      manner. The witness offered a remark on the weather; and the gentleman
      said, "Yes, it looks like a bad night"&mdash;and so went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postmaster's evidence was of importance in one respect: it suggested
      the motive which had brought the deceased to Zeeland. The letter addressed
      to "J. B." was, in all probability, the letter seen by Mrs. Rook among the
      contents of the pocketbook, spread out on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inquiry being, so far, at an end, the inquest was adjourned&mdash;on
      the chance of obtaining additional evidence, when the reported proceedings
      were read by the public.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    ........

    <p>
      Consulting a later number of the newspaper Emily discovered that the
      deceased person had been identified by a witness from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Forth, gentleman's valet, being examined, made the following
      statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      He had read the medical evidence contained in the report of the inquest;
      and, believing that he could identify the deceased, had been sent by his
      present master to assist the object of the inquiry. Ten days since, being
      then out of place, he had answered an advertisement. The next day, he was
      instructed to call at Tracey's Hotel, London, at six o'clock in the
      evening, and to ask for Mr. James Brown. Arriving at the hotel he saw the
      gentleman for a few minutes only. Mr. Brown had a friend with him. After
      glancing over the valet's references, he said, "I haven't time enough to
      speak to you this evening. Call here to-morrow morning at nine o'clock."
      The gentleman who was present laughed, and said, "You won't be up!" Mr.
      Brown answered, "That won't matter; the man can come to my bedroom, and
      let me see how he understands his duties, on trial." At nine the next
      morning, Mr. Brown was reported to be still in bed; and the witness was
      informed of the number of the room. He knocked at the door. A drowsy voice
      inside said something, which he interpreted as meaning "Come in." He went
      in. The toilet-table was on his left hand, and the bed (with the lower
      curtain drawn) was on his right. He saw on the table a tumbler with a
      little water in it, and with two false teeth in the water. Mr. Brown
      started up in bed&mdash;looked at him furiously&mdash;abused him for
      daring to enter the room&mdash;and shouted to him to "get out." The
      witness, not accustomed to be treated in that way, felt naturally
      indignant, and at once withdrew&mdash;but not before he had plainly seen
      the vacant place which the false teeth had been made to fill. Perhaps Mr.
      Brown had forgotten that he had left his teeth on the table. Or perhaps he
      (the valet) had misunderstood what had been said to him when he knocked at
      the door. Either way, it seemed to be plain enough that the gentleman
      resented the discovery of his false teeth by a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having concluded his statement the witness proceeded to identify the
      remains of the deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once recognized the gentleman named James Brown, whom he had twice
      seen&mdash;once in the evening, and again the next morning&mdash;at
      Tracey's Hotel. In answer to further inquiries, he declared that he knew
      nothing of the family, or of the place of residence, of the deceased. He
      complained to the proprietor of the hotel of the rude treatment that he
      had received, and asked if Mr. Tracey knew anything of Mr. James Brown.
      Mr. Tracey knew nothing of him. On consulting the hotel book it was found
      that he had given notice to leave, that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before returning to London, the witness produced references which gave him
      an excellent character. He also left the address of the master who had
      engaged him three days since.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last precaution adopted was to have the face of the corpse
      photographed, before the coffin was closed. On the same day the jury
      agreed on their verdict: "Willful murder against some person unknown."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         ........
</pre>
    <p>
      Two days later, Emily found a last allusion to the crime&mdash;extracted
      from the columns of the <i>South Hampshire Gazette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A relative of the deceased, seeing the report of the adjourned inquest,
      had appeared (accompanied by a medical gentleman); had seen the
      photograph; and had declared the identification by Henry Forth to be
      correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other particulars, now communicated for the first time, it was
      stated that the late Mr. James Brown had been unreasonably sensitive on
      the subject of his false teeth, and that the one member of his family who
      knew of his wearing them was the relative who now claimed his remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The claim having been established to the satisfaction of the authorities,
      the corpse was removed by railroad the same day. No further light had been
      thrown on the murder. The Handbill offering the reward, and describing the
      suspected man, had failed to prove of any assistance to the investigations
      of the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that date, no further notice of the crime committed at the
      Hand-in-Hand inn appeared in the public journals.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         ........
</pre>
    <p>
      Emily closed the volume which she had been consulting, and thankfully
      acknowledged the services of the librarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new reader had excited this gentleman's interest. Noticing how
      carefully she examined the numbers of the old newspaper, he looked at her,
      from time to time, wondering whether it was good news or bad of which she
      was in search. She read steadily and continuously; but she never rewarded
      his curiosity by any outward sign of the impression that had been produced
      on her. When she left the room there was nothing to remark in her manner;
      she looked quietly thoughtful&mdash;and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The librarian smiled&mdash;amused by his own folly. Because a stranger's
      appearance had attracted him, he had taken it for granted that
      circumstances of romantic interest must be connected with her visit to the
      library. Far from misleading him, as he supposed, his fancy might have
      been employed to better purpose, if it had taken a higher flight still&mdash;and
      had associated Emily with the fateful gloom of tragedy, in place of the
      brighter interest of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, among the ordinary readers of the day, was a dutiful and
      affectionate daughter following the dreadful story of the death of her
      father by murder, and believing it to be the story of a stranger&mdash;because
      she loved and trusted the person whose short-sighted mercy had deceived
      her. That very discovery, the dread of which had shaken the good doctor's
      firm nerves, had forced Alban to exclude from his confidence the woman
      whom he loved, and had driven the faithful old servant from the bedside of
      her dying mistress&mdash;that very discovery Emily had now made, with a
      face which never changed color, and a heart which beat at ease. Was the
      deception that had won this cruel victory over truth destined still to
      triumph in the days which were to come? Yes&mdash;if the life of earth is
      a foretaste of the life of hell. No&mdash;if a lie <i>is</i> a lie, be the
      merciful motive for the falsehood what it may. No&mdash;if all deceit
      contains in it the seed of retribution, to be ripened inexorably in the
      lapse of time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. MOTHER EVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The servant received Emily, on her return from the library, with a sly
      smile. "Here he is again, miss, waiting to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the parlor door, and revealed Alban Morris, as restless as
      ever, walking up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I missed you at the Museum, I was afraid you might be ill," he said.
      "Ought I to have gone away, when my anxiety was relieved? Shall I go away
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must take a chair, Mr. Morris, and hear what I have to say for
      myself. When you left me after your last visit, I suppose I felt the force
      of example. At any rate I, like you, had my suspicions. I have been trying
      to confirm them&mdash;and I have failed."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, with the chair in his hand. "Suspicions of Me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly! Can you guess how I have been employed for the last two days?
      No&mdash;not even your ingenuity can do that. I have been hard at work, in
      another reading-room, consulting the same back numbers of the same
      newspaper, which you have been examining at the British Museum. There is
      my confession&mdash;and now we will have some tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the fireplace, to ring the bell, and failed to see the effect
      produced on Alban by those lightly-uttered words. The common phrase is the
      only phrase that can describe it. He was thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she resumed, "I have read the report of the inquest. If I know
      nothing else, I know that the murder at Zeeland can't be the discovery
      which you are bent on keeping from me. Don't be alarmed for the
      preservation of your secret! I am too much discouraged to try again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant interrupted them by answering the bell; Alban once more
      escaped detection. Emily gave her orders with an approach to the old
      gayety of her school days. "Tea, as soon as possible&mdash;and let us have
      the new cake. Are you too much of a man, Mr. Morris, to like cake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of agitation, he was unreasonably irritated by that playful
      question. "There is one thing I like better than cake," he said; "and that
      one thing is a plain explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone puzzled her. "Have I said anything to offend you?" she asked.
      "Surely you can make allowance for a girl's curiosity? Oh, you shall have
      your explanation&mdash;and, what is more, you shall have it without
      reserve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as good as her word. What she had thought, and what she had
      planned, when he left her after his last visit, was frankly and fully
      told. "If you wonder how I discovered the library," she went on, "I must
      refer you to my aunt's lawyer. He lives in the City&mdash;and I wrote to
      him to help me. I don't consider that my time has been wasted. Mr. M
      orris, we owe an apology to Mrs. Rook."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's astonishment, when he heard this, forced its way to expression in
      words. "What can you possibly mean?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea was brought in before Emily could reply. She filled the cups, and
      sighed as she looked at the cake. "If Cecilia was here, how she would
      enjoy it!" With that complimentary tribute to her friend, she handed a
      slice to Alban. He never even noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have both of us behaved most unkindly to Mrs. Rook," she resumed. "I
      can excuse your not seeing it; for I should not have seen it either, but
      for the newspaper. While I was reading, I had an opportunity of thinking
      over what we said and did, when the poor woman's behavior so needlessly
      offended us. I was too excited to think, at the time&mdash;and, besides, I
      had been upset, only the night before, by what Miss Jethro said to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban started. "What has Miss Jethro to do with it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at all," Emily answered. "She spoke to me of her own private
      affairs. A long story&mdash;and you wouldn't be interested in it. Let me
      finish what I had to say. Mrs. Rook was naturally reminded of the murder,
      when she heard that my name was Brown; and she must certainly have been
      struck&mdash;as I was&mdash;by the coincidence of my father's death taking
      place at the same time when his unfortunate namesake was killed. Doesn't
      this sufficiently account for her agitation when she looked at the locket?
      We first took her by surprise: and then we suspected her of Heaven knows
      what, because the poor creature didn't happen to have her wits about her,
      and to remember at the right moment what a very common name 'James Brown'
      is. Don't you see it as I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that you have arrived at a remarkable change of opinion, since we
      spoke of the subject in the garden at school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my place, you would have changed your opinion too. I shall write to
      Mrs. Rook by tomorrow's post."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban heard her with dismay. "Pray be guided by my advice!" he said
      earnestly. "Pray don't write that letter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to recall the words which he had rashly allowed to escape
      him. How could he reply?
    </p>
    <p>
      To own that he had not only read what Emily had read, but had carefully
      copied the whole narrative and considered it at his leisure, appeared to
      be simply impossible after what he had now heard. Her peace of mind
      depended absolutely on his discretion. In this serious emergency, silence
      was a mercy, and silence was a lie. If he remained silent, might the mercy
      be trusted to atone for the lie? He was too fond of Emily to decide that
      question fairly, on its own merits. In other words, he shrank from the
      terrible responsibility of telling her the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't the imprudence of writing to such a person as Mrs. Rook plain
      enough to speak for itself?" he suggested cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made that reply rather obstinately. Alban seemed (in her view) to be
      trying to prevent her from atoning for an act of injustice. Besides, he
      despised her cake. "I want to know why you object," she said; taking back
      the neglected slice, and eating it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I object," Alban answered, "because Mrs. Rook is a coarse presuming
      woman. She may pervert your letter to some use of her own, which you may
      have reason to regret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be enough for <i>you</i>. When I have done a person an injury, and
      wish to make an apology, I don't think it necessary to inquire whether the
      person's manners happen to be vulgar or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's patience was still equal to any demands that she could make on it.
      "I can only offer you advice which is honestly intended for your own
      good," he gently replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would have more influence over me, Mr. Morris, if you were a little
      readier to take me into your confidence. I daresay I am wrong&mdash;but I
      don't like following advice which is given to me in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to offend him. "Very naturally," he said; "I don't blame
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her color deepened, and her voice rose. Alban's patient adherence to his
      own view&mdash;so courteously and considerately urged&mdash;was beginning
      to try her temper. "In plain words," she rejoined, "I am to believe that
      you can't be mistaken in your judgment of another person."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a ring at the door of the cottage while she was speaking. But
      she was too warmly interested in confuting Alban to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite willing to be confuted. Even when she lost her temper, she
      was still interesting to him. "I don't expect you to think me infallible,"
      he said. "Perhaps you will remember that I have had some experience. I am
      unfortunately older than you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh if wisdom comes with age," she smartly reminded him, "your friend Miss
      Redwood is old enough to be your mother&mdash;and she suspected Mrs. Rook
      of murder, because the poor woman looked at a door, and disliked being in
      the next room to a fidgety old maid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's manner changed: he shrank from that chance allusion to doubts and
      fears which he dare not acknowledge. "Let us talk of something else," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a saucy smile. "Have I driven you into a corner at
      last? And is <i>that</i> your way of getting out of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even his endurance failed. "Are you trying to provoke me?" he asked. "Are
      you no better than other women? I wouldn't have believed it of you,
      Emily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily?" She repeated the name in a tone of surprise, which reminded him
      that he had addressed her with familiarity at a most inappropriate time&mdash;the
      time when they were on the point of a quarrel. He felt the implied
      reproach too keenly to be able to answer her with composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think of Emily&mdash;I love Emily&mdash;my one hope is that Emily may
      love me. Oh, my dear, is there no excuse if I forget to call you 'Miss'
      when you distress me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      All that was tender and true in her nature secretly took his part. She
      would have followed that better impulse, if he had only been calm enough
      to understand her momentary silence, and to give her time. But the temper
      of a gentle and generous man, once roused, is slow to subside. Alban
      abruptly left his chair. "I had better go!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please," she answered. "Whether you go, Mr. Morris, or whether you
      stay, I shall write to Mrs. Rook."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring at the bell was followed by the appearance of a visitor. Doctor
      Allday opened the door, just in time to hear Emily's last words. Her
      vehemence seemed to amuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Mrs. Rook?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A most respectable person," Emily answered indignantly; "housekeeper to
      Sir Jervis Redwood. You needn't sneer at her, Doctor Allday! She has not
      always been in service&mdash;she was landlady of the inn at Zeeland."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, about to put his hat on a chair, paused. The inn at Zeeland
      reminded him of the Handbill, and of the visit of Miss Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you so hot over it?" he inquired
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I detest prejudice!" With this assertion of liberal feeling she
      pointed to Alban, standing quietly apart at the further end of the room.
      "There is the most prejudiced man living&mdash;he hates Mrs. Rook. Would
      you like to be introduced to him? You're a philosopher; you may do him
      some good. Doctor Allday&mdash;Mr. Alban Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor recognized the man, with the felt hat and the objectionable
      beard, whose personal appearance had not impressed him favorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they may hesitate to acknowledge it, there are respectable
      Englishmen still left, who regard a felt hat and a beard as symbols of
      republican disaffection to the altar and the throne. Doctor Allday's
      manner might have expressed this curious form of patriotic feeling, but
      for the associations which Emily had revived. In his present frame of
      mind, he was outwardly courteous, because he was inwardly suspicious. Mrs.
      Rook had been described to him as formerly landlady of the inn at Zeeland.
      Were there reasons for Mr. Morris's hostile feeling toward this woman
      which might be referable to the crime committed in her house that might
      threaten Emily's tranquillity if they were made known? It would not be
      amiss to see a little more of Mr. Morris, on the first convenient
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to make your acquaintance, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, Doctor Allday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The exchange of polite conventionalities having been accomplished, Alban
      approached Emily to take his leave, with mingled feelings of regret and
      anxiety&mdash;regret for having allowed himself to speak harshly; anxiety
      to part with her in kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you forgive me for differing from you?" It was all he could venture
      to say, in the presence of a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!" she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you think again, before you decide?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Mr. Morris. But it won't alter my opinion, if I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, hearing what passed between them, frowned. On what subject had
      they been differing? And what opinion did Emily decline to alter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban gave it up. He took her hand gently. "Shall I see you at the Museum,
      to-morrow?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was politely indifferent to the last. "Yes&mdash;unless something
      happens to keep me at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's eyebrows still expressed disapproval. For what object was the
      meeting proposed? And why at a museum?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-afternoon, Doctor Allday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-afternoon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment after Alban's departure, the doctor stood irresolute.
      Arriving suddenly at a decision, he snatched up his hat, and turned to
      Emily in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bring you news, my dear, which will surprise you. Who do you think has
      just left my house? Mrs. Ellmother! Don't interrupt me. She has made up
      her mind to go out to service again. Tired of leading an idle life&mdash;that's
      her own account of it&mdash;and asks me to act as her reference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you consent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consent! If I act as her reference, I shall be asked how she came to
      leave her last place. A nice dilemma! Either I must own that she deserted
      her mistress on her deathbed&mdash;or tell a lie. When I put it to her in
      that way, she walked out of the house in dead silence. If she applies to
      you next, receive her as I did&mdash;or decline to see her, which would be
      better still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why am I to decline to see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In consequence of her behavior to your aunt, to be sure! No: I have said
      all I wanted to say&mdash;and I have no time to spare for answering idle
      questions. Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      Socially-speaking, doctors try the patience of their nearest and dearest
      friends, in this respect&mdash;they are almost always in a hurry. Doctor
      Allday's precipitate departure did not tend to soothe Emily's irritated
      nerves. She began to find excuses for Mrs. Ellmother in a spirit of pure
      contradiction. The old servant's behavior might admit of justification: a
      friendly welcome might persuade her to explain herself. "If she applies to
      me," Emily determined, "I shall certainly receive her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this resolution, her mind reverted to Alban.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the sharp things she had said to him, subjected to
      after-reflection in solitude, failed to justify themselves. Her better
      sense began to reproach her. She tried to silence that unwelcome monitor
      by laying the blame on Alban. Why had he been so patient and so good? What
      harm was there in his calling her "Emily"? If he had told her to call <i>him</i>
      by his Christian name, she might have done it. How noble he looked, when
      he got up to go away; he was actually handsome! Women may say what they
      please and write what they please: their natural instinct is to find their
      master in a man&mdash;especially when they like him. Sinking lower and
      lower in her own estimation, Emily tried to turn the current of her
      thoughts in another direction. She took up a book&mdash;opened it, looked
      into it, threw it across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Alban had returned at that moment, resolved on a reconciliation&mdash;if
      he had said, "My dear, I want to see you like yourself again; will you
      give me a kiss, and make it up"&mdash;would he have left her crying, when
      he went away? She was crying now.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. MENTOR AND TELEMACHUS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Emily's eyes could have followed Alban as her thoughts were following
      him, she would have seen him stop before he reached the end of the road in
      which the cottage stood. His heart was full of tenderness and sorrow: the
      longing to return to her was more than he could resist. It would be easy
      to wait, within view of the gate, until the doctor's visit came to an end.
      He had just decided to go back and keep watch&mdash;when he heard rapid
      footsteps approaching. There (devil take him!) was the doctor himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have something to say to you, Mr. Morris. Which way are you walking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any way," Alban answered&mdash;not very graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let us take the turning that leads to my house. It's not customary
      for strangers, especially when they happen to be Englishmen, to place
      confidence in each other. Let me set the example of violating that rule. I
      want to speak to you about Miss Emily. May I take your arm? Thank you. At
      my age, girls in general&mdash;unless they are my patients&mdash;are not
      objects of interest to me. But that girl at the cottage&mdash;I daresay I
      am in my dotage&mdash;I tell you, sir, she has bewitched me! Upon my soul,
      I could hardly be more anxious about her, if I was her father. And, mind,
      I am not an affectionate man by nature. Are you anxious about her too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way are you anxious, Doctor Allday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't trust me? Well, I have promised to set the example. Keep your
      mask on, sir&mdash;mine is off, come what may of it. But, observe: if you
      repeat what I am going to say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban would hear no more. "Whatever you may say, Doctor Allday, is trusted
      to my honor. If you doubt my honor, be so good as to let go my arm&mdash;I
      am not walking your way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's hand tightened its grasp. "That little flourish of temper, my
      dear sir, is all I want to set me at my ease. I feel I have got hold of
      the right man. Now answer me this. Have you ever heard of a person named
      Miss Jethro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban suddenly came to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right!" said the doctor. "I couldn't have wished for a more
      satisfactory reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute," Alban interposed. "I know Miss Jethro as a teacher at
      Miss Ladd's school, who left her situation suddenly&mdash;and I know no
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's peculiar smile made its appearance again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speaking in the vulgar tone," he said, "you seem to be in a hurry to wash
      your hands of Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no reason to feel any interest in her," Alban replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be too sure of that, my friend. I have something to tell you which
      may alter your opinion. That ex-teacher at the school, sir, knows how the
      late Mr. Brown met his death, and how his daughter has been deceived about
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban listened with surprise&mdash;and with some little doubt, which he
      thought it wise not to acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The report of the inquest alludes to a 'relative' who claimed the body,"
      he said. "Was that 'relative' the person who deceived Miss Emily? And was
      the person her aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must leave you to take your own view," Doctor Allday replied. "A
      promise binds me not to repeat the information that I have received.
      Setting that aside, we have the same object in view&mdash;and we must take
      care not to get in each other's way. Here is my house. Let us go in, and
      make a clean breast of it on both sides."
    </p>
    <p>
      Established in the safe seclusion of his study, the doctor set the example
      of confession in these plain terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We only differ in opinion on one point," he said. "We both think it
      likely (from our experience of the women) that the suspected murderer had
      an accomplice. I say the guilty person is Miss Jethro. You say&mdash;Mrs.
      Rook."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have read my copy of the report," Alban answered, "I think you
      will arrive at my conclusion. Mrs. Rook might have entered the outhouse in
      which the two men slept, at any time during the night, while her husband
      was asleep. The jury believed her when she declared that she never woke
      till the morning. I don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am open to conviction, Mr. Morris. Now about the future. Do you mean to
      go on with your inquiries?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even if I had no other motive than mere curiosity," Alban answered, "I
      think I should go on. But I have a more urgent purpose in view. All that I
      have done thus far, has been done in Emily's interests. My object, from
      the first, has been to preserve her from any association&mdash;in the past
      or in the future&mdash;with the woman whom I believe to have been
      concerned in her father's death. As I have already told you, she is
      innocently doing all she can, poor thing, to put obstacles in my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said the doctor; "she means to write to Mrs. Rook&mdash;and
      you have nearly quarreled about it. Trust me to take that matter in hand.
      I don't regard it as serious. But I am mortally afraid of what you are
      doing in Emily's interests. I wish you would give it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I see a danger. I don't deny that Emily is as innocent of
      suspicion as ever. But the chances, next time, may be against us. How do
      you know to what lengths your curiosity may lead you? Or on what shocking
      discoveries you may not blunder with the best intentions? Some unforeseen
      accident may open her eyes to the truth, before you can prevent it. I seem
      to surprise you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do, indeed, surprise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the old story, my dear sir, Mentor sometimes surprised Telemachus. I
      am Mentor&mdash;without being, I hope, quite so long-winded as that
      respectable philosopher. Let me put it in two words. Emily's happiness is
      precious to you. Take care you are not made the means of wrecking it! Will
      you consent to a sacrifice, for her sake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do anything for her sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you give up your inquiries?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From this moment I have done with them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Morris, you are the best friend she has."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next best friend to you, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      In that fond persuasion they now parted&mdash;too eagerly devoted to Emily
      to look at the prospect before them in its least hopeful aspect. Both
      clever men, neither one nor the other asked himself if any human
      resistance has ever yet obstructed the progress of truth&mdash;when truth
      has once begun to force its way to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time Alban stopped, on his way home. The longing to be
      reconciled with Emily was not to be resisted. He returned to the cottage,
      only to find disappointment waiting for him. The servant reported that her
      young mistress had gone to bed with a bad headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban waited a day, in the hope that Emily might write to him. No letter
      arrived. He repeated his visit the next morning. Fortune was still against
      him. On this occasion, Emily was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Engaged with a visitor?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. A young lady named Miss de Sor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Where had he heard that name before? He remembered immediately that he had
      heard it at the school. Miss de Sor was the unattractive new pupil, whom
      the girls called Francine. Alban looked at the parlor window as he left
      the cottage. It was of serious importance that he should set himself right
      with Emily. "And mere gossip," he thought contemptuously, "stands in my
      way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been less absorbed in his own interests, he might have
      remembered that mere gossip is not always to be despised. It has worked
      fatal mischief in its time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. FRANCINE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "You're surprised to see me, of course?" Saluting Emily in those terms,
      Francine looked round the parlor with an air of satirical curiosity. "Dear
      me, what a little place to live in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What brings you to London?" Emily inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to know, my dear, without asking. Why did I try to make friends
      with you at school? And why have I been trying ever since? Because I hate
      you&mdash;I mean because I can't resist you&mdash;no! I mean because I
      hate myself for liking you. Oh, never mind my reasons. I insisted on going
      to London with Miss Ladd&mdash;when that horrid woman announced that she
      had an appointment with her lawyer. I said, 'I want to see Emily.' 'Emily
      doesn't like you.' 'I don't care whether she likes me or not; I want to
      see her.' That's the way we snap at each other, and that's how I always
      carry my point. Here I am, till my duenna finishes her business and
      fetches me. What a prospect for You! Have you got any cold meat in the
      house? I'm not a glutton, like Cecilia&mdash;but I'm afraid I shall want
      some lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk in that way, Francine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say you're glad to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were only a little less hard and bitter, I should always be glad
      to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You darling! (excuse my impetuosity). What are you looking at? My new
      dress? Do you envy me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I admire the color&mdash;that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine rose, and shook out her dress, and showed it from every point of
      view. "See how it's made: Paris, of course! Money, my dear; money will do
      anything&mdash;except making one learn one's lessons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not getting on any better, Francine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse, my sweet friend&mdash;worse. One of the masters, I am happy to
      say, has flatly refused to teach me any longer. 'Pupils without brains I
      am accustomed to,' he said in his broken English; 'but a pupil with no
      heart is beyond my endurance.' Ha! ha! the mouldy old refugee has an eye
      for character, though. No heart&mdash;there I am, described in two words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And proud of it," Emily remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;proud of it. Stop! let me do myself justice. You consider tears
      a sign that one has some heart, don't you? I was very near crying last
      Sunday. A popular preacher did it; no less a person that Mr. Mirabel&mdash;you
      look as if you had heard of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard of him from Cecilia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is <i>she</i> at Brighton? Then there's one fool more in a fashionable
      watering place. Oh, she's in Switzerland, is she? I don't care where she
      is; I only care about Mr. Mirabel. We all heard he was at Brighton for his
      health, and was going to preach. Didn't we cram the church! As to
      describing him, I give it up. He is the only little man I ever admired&mdash;hair
      as long as mine, and the sort of beard you see in pictures. I wish I had
      his fair complexion and his white hands. We were all in love with him&mdash;or
      with his voice, which was it?&mdash;when he began to read the
      commandments. I wish I could imitate him when he came to the fifth
      commandment. He began in his deepest bass voice: 'Honor thy father&mdash;'
      He stopped and looked up to heaven as if he saw the rest of it there. He
      went on with a tremendous emphasis on the next word. '<i>And</i> thy
      mother,' he said (as if that was quite a different thing) in a tearful,
      fluty, quivering voice which was a compliment to mothers in itself. We all
      felt it, mothers or not. But the great sensation was when he got into the
      pulpit. The manner in which he dropped on his knees, and hid his face in
      his hands, and showed his beautiful rings was, as a young lady said behind
      me, simply seraphic. We understood his celebrity, from that moment&mdash;I
      wonder whether I can remember the sermon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't attempt it on my account," Emily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, don't be obstinate. Wait till you hear him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite content to wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you're just in the right state of mind to be converted; you're in a
      fair way to become one of his greatest admirers. They say he is so
      agreeable in private life; I am dying to know him.&mdash;Do I hear a ring
      at the bell? Is somebody else coming to see you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant brought in a card and a message.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person will call again, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked at the name written on the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Ellmother!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an extraordinary name!" cried Francine. "Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My aunt's old servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she want a situation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked at some lines of writing at the back of the card. Doctor
      Allday had rightly foreseen events. Rejected by the doctor, Mrs. Ellmother
      had no alternative but to ask Emily to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she is out of place," Francine went on, "she may be just the sort of
      person I am looking for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" Emily asked, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine refused to explain until she got an answer to her question. "Tell
      me first," she said, "is Mrs. Ellmother engaged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; she wants an engagement, and she asks me to be her reference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she sober, honest, middle-aged, clean, steady, good-tempered,
      industrious?" Francine rattled on. "Has she all the virtues, and none of
      the vices? Is she not too good-looking, and has she no male followers? In
      one terrible word&mdash;will she satisfy Miss Ladd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has Miss Ladd to do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How stupid you are, Emily! Do put the woman's card down on the table, and
      listen to me. Haven't I told you that one of my masters has declined to
      have anything more to do with me? Doesn't that help you to understand how
      I get on with the rest of them? I am no longer Miss Ladd's pupil, my dear.
      Thanks to my laziness and my temper, I am to be raised to the dignity of
      'a parlor boarder.' In other words, I am to be a young lady who patronizes
      the school; with a room of my own, and a servant of my own. All provided
      for by a private arrangement between my father and Miss Ladd, before I
      left the West Indies. My mother was at the bottom of it, I have not the
      least doubt. You don't appear to understand me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't, indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine considered a little. "Perhaps they were fond of you at home," she
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say they loved me, Francine&mdash;and I loved them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my position is just the reverse of yours. Now they have got rid of
      me, they don't want me back again at home. I know as well what my mother
      said to my father, as if I had heard her. 'Francine will never get on at
      school, at her age. Try her, by all means; but make some other arrangement
      with Miss Ladd in case of a failure&mdash;or she will be returned on our
      hands like a bad shilling.' There is my mother, my anxious, affectionate
      mother, hit off to a T."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She <i>is</i> your mother, Francine; don't forget that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; I won't forget it. My cat is my kitten's mother&mdash;there!
      there! I won't shock your sensibilities. Let us get back to matter of
      fact. When I begin my new life, Miss Ladd makes one condition. My maid is
      to be a model of discretion&mdash;an elderly woman, not a skittish young
      person who will only encourage me. I must submit to the elderly woman, or
      I shall be sent back to the West Indies after all. How long did Mrs.
      Ellmother live with your aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-five years, and more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens, it's a lifetime! Why isn't this amazing creature living
      with you, now your aunt is dead? Did you send her away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why did she go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that she went away without a word of explanation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; that is exactly what I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did she go? As soon as your aunt was dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't matter, Francine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In plain English, you won't tell me? I am all on fire with curiosity&mdash;and
      that's how you put me out! My dear, if you have the slightest regard for
      me, let us have the woman in here when she comes back for her answer.
      Somebody must satisfy me. I mean to make Mrs. Ellmother explain herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you will succeed, Francine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a little, and you will see. By-the-by, it is understood that my new
      position at the school gives me the privilege of accepting invitations. Do
      you know any nice people to whom you can introduce me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the last person in the world who has a chance of helping you," Emily
      answered. "Excepting good Doctor Allday&mdash;" On the point of adding the
      name of Alban Morris, she checked herself without knowing why, and
      substituted the name of her school-friend. "And not forgetting Cecilia,"
      she resumed, "I know nobody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cecilia's a fool," Francine remarked gravely; "but now I think of it, she
      may be worth cultivating. Her father is a member of Parliament&mdash;and
      didn't I hear that he has a fine place in the country? You see, Emily, I
      may expect to be married (with my money), if I can only get into good
      society. (Don't suppose I am dependent on my father; my marriage portion
      is provided for in my uncle's will.) Cecilia may really be of some use to
      me. Why shouldn't I make a friend of her, and get introduced to her father&mdash;in
      the autumn, you know, when the house is full of company? Have you any idea
      when she is coming back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think of writing to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give her my kind love; and say I hope she enjoys Switzerland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Francine, you are positively shameless! After calling my dearest friend a
      fool and a glutton, you send her your love for your own selfish ends; and
      you expect me to help you in deceiving her! I won't do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your temper, my child. We are all selfish, you little goose. The
      only difference is&mdash;some of us own it, and some of us don't. I shall
      find my own way to Cecilia's good graces quite easily: the way is through
      her mouth. You mentioned a certain Doctor Allday. Does he give parties?
      And do the right sort of men go to them? Hush! I think I hear the bell
      again. Go to the door, and see who it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily waited, without taking any notice of this suggestion. The servant
      announced that "the person had called again, to know if there was any
      answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show her in here," Emily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant withdrew, and came back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person doesn't wish to intrude, miss; it will be quite sufficient if
      you will send a message by me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily crossed the room to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Mrs. Ellmother," she said. "You have been too long away already.
      Pray come in."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. "BONY."
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Mrs. Ellmother reluctantly entered the room.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since Emily had seen her last, her personal appearance doubly justified
      the nickname by which her late mistress had distinguished her. The old
      servant was worn and wasted; her gown hung loose on her angular body; the
      big bones of her face stood out, more prominently than ever. She took
      Emily's offered hand doubtingly. "I hope I see you well, miss," she said&mdash;with
      hardly a vestige left of her former firmness of voice and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid you have been suffering from illness," Emily answered gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the life I'm leading that wears me down; I want work and change."
    </p>
    <p>
      Making that reply, she looked round, and discovered Francine observing her
      with undisguised curiosity. "You have got company with you," she said to
      Emily. "I had better go away, and come back another time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine stopped her before she could open the door. "You mustn't go away;
      I wish to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About what, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two women met&mdash;one, near the end of her life,
      concealing under a rugged surface a nature sensitively affectionate and
      incorruptibly true: the other, young in years, with out the virtues of
      youth, hard in manner and hard at heart. In silence on either side, they
      stood face to face; strangers brought together by the force of
      circumstances, working inexorably toward their hidden end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily introduced Mrs. Ellmother to Francine. "It may be worth your while,"
      she hinted, "to hear what this young lady has to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother listened, with little appearance of interest in anything
      that a stranger might have to say: her eyes rested on the card which
      contained her written request to Emily. Francine, watching her closely,
      understood what was passing in her mind. It might be worth while to
      conciliate the old woman by a little act of attention. Turning to Emily,
      Francine pointed to the card lying on the table. "You have not attended
      yet to Mr. Ellmother's request," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily at once assured Mrs. Ellmother that the request was granted. "But is
      it wise," she asked, "to go out to service again, at your age?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been used to service all my life, Miss Emily&mdash;that's one
      reason. And service may help me to get rid of my own thoughts&mdash;that's
      another. If you can find me a situation somewhere, you will be doing me a
      good turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it useless to suggest that you might come back, and live with me?"
      Emily ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother's head sank on her breast. "Thank you kindly, miss; it <i>is</i>
      useless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is it useless?" Francine asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss de Sor is speaking to you," Emily reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to answer Miss de Sor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Attentively observing what passed, and placing her own construction on
      looks and tones, it suddenly struck Francine that Emily herself might be
      in Mrs. Ellmother's confidence, and that she might have reasons of her own
      for assuming ignorance when awkward questions were asked. For the moment
      at least, Francine decided on keeping her suspicions to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may perhaps offer you the employment you want," she said to Mrs.
      Ellmother. "I am staying at Brighton, for the present, with the lady who
      was Miss Emily's schoolmistress, and I am in need of a maid. Would you be
      willing to consider it, if I proposed to engage you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, you can hardly object to the customary inquiry. Why did you
      leave your last place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother appealed to Emily. "Did you tell this young lady how long I
      remained in my last place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Melancholy remembrances had been revived in Emily by the turn which the
      talk had now taken. Francine's cat-like patience, stealthily feeling its
      way to its end, jarred on her nerves. "Yes," she said; "in justice to you,
      I have mentioned your long term of service."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother addressed Francine. "You know, miss, that I served my late
      mistress for over twenty-five years. Will you please remember that&mdash;and
      let it be a reason for not asking me why I left my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine smiled compassionately. "My good creature, you have mentioned the
      very reason why I <i>should</i> ask. You live five-and-twenty years with
      your mistress&mdash;and then suddenly leave her&mdash;and you expect me to
      pass over this extraordinary proceeding without inquiry. Take a little
      time to think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want no time to think. What I had in my mind, when I left Miss Letitia,
      is something which I refuse to explain, miss, to you, or to anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered some of her old firmness, when she made that reply. Francine
      saw the necessity of yielding&mdash;for the time at least, Emily remained
      silent, oppressed by remembrance of the doubts and fears which had
      darkened the last miserable days of her aunt's illness. She began already
      to regret having made Francine and Mrs. Ellmother known to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't dwell on what appears to be a painful subject," Francine
      graciously resumed. "I meant no offense. You are not angry, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, miss. I might have been angry, at one time. That time is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said sadly and resignedly: Emily heard the answer. Her heart ached
      as she looked at the old servant, and thought of the contrast between past
      and present. With what a hearty welcome this broken woman had been used to
      receive her in the bygone holiday-time! Her eyes moistened. She felt the
      merciless persistency of Francine, as if it had been an insult offered to
      herself. "Give it up!" she said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me, my dear, to manage my own business," Francine replied. "About
      your qualifications?" she continued, turning coolly to Mrs. Ellmother.
      "Can you dress hair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to tell you," Francine insisted, "that I am very particular about
      my hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mistress was very particular about her hair," Mrs. Ellmother answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a good needlewoman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As good as ever I was&mdash;with the help of my spectacles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine turned to Emily. "See how well we get on together. We are
      beginning to understand each other already. I am an odd creature, Mrs.
      Ellmother. Sometimes, I take sudden likings to persons&mdash;I have taken
      a liking to you. Do you begin to think a little better of me than you did?
      I hope you will produce the right impression on Miss Ladd; you shall have
      every assistance that I can give. I will beg Miss Ladd, as a favor to me,
      not to ask you that one forbidden question."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Ellmother, puzzled by the sudden appearance of Francine in the
      character of an eccentric young lady, the creature of genial impulse,
      thought it right to express her gratitude for the promised interference in
      her favor. "That's kind of you, miss," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, only just. I ought to tell you there's one thing Miss Ladd is
      strict about&mdash;sweethearts. Are you quite sure," Francine inquired
      jocosely, "that you can answer for yourself, in that particular?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This effort of humor produced its intended effect. Mrs. Ellmother, thrown
      off her guard, actually smiled. "Lord, miss, what will you say next!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good soul, I will say something next that is more to the purpose. If
      Miss Ladd asks me why you have so unaccountably refused to be a servant
      again in this house, I shall take care to say that it is certainly not out
      of dislike to Miss Emily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need say nothing of the sort," Emily quietly remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And still less," Francine proceeded, without noticing the interruption&mdash;"still
      less through any disagreeable remembrances of Miss Emily's aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother saw the trap that had been set for her. "It won't do,
      miss," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What won't do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trying to pump me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine burst out laughing. Emily noticed an artificial ring in her
      gayety which suggested that she was exasperated, rather than amused, by
      the repulse which had baffled her curiosity once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother reminded the merry young lady that the proposed arrangement
      between them had not been concluded yet. "Am I to understand, miss, that
      you will keep a place open for me in your service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to understand," Francine replied sharply, "that I must have Miss
      Ladd's approval before I can engage you. Suppose you come to Brighton? I
      will pay your fare, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind my fare, miss. Will you give up pumping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make your mind easy. It's quite useless to attempt pumping <i>you</i>.
      When will you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother pleaded for a little delay. "I'm altering my gowns," she
      said. "I get thinner and thinner&mdash;don't I, Miss Emily? My work won't
      be done before Thursday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us say Friday, then," Francine proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friday!" Mrs. Ellmother exclaimed. "You forget that Friday is an unlucky
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot that, certainly! How can you be so absurdly superstitious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may call it what you like, miss. I have good reason to think as I do.
      I was married on a Friday&mdash;and a bitter bad marriage it turned out to
      be. Superstitious, indeed! You don't know what my experience has been. My
      only sister was one of a party of thirteen at dinner; and she died within
      the year. If we are to get on together nicely, I'll take that journey on
      Saturday, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything to satisfy you," Francine agreed; "there is the address. Come in
      the middle of the day, and we will give you your dinner. No fear of our
      being thirteen in number. What will you do, if you have the misfortune to
      spill the salt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a pinch between my finger and thumb, and throw it over my left
      shoulder," Mrs. Ellmother answered gravely. "Good-day, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily followed the departing visitor out to the hall. She had seen and
      heard enough to decide her on trying to break off the proposed negotiation&mdash;with
      the one kind purpose of protecting Mrs. Ellmother against the pitiless
      curiosity of Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you and that young lady are likely to get on well together?"
      she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have told you already, Miss Emily, I want to get away from my own home
      and my own thoughts; I don't care where I go, so long as I do that."
      Having answered in those words, Mrs. Ellmother opened the door, and waited
      a while, thinking. "I wonder whether the dead know what is going on in the
      world they have left?" she said, looking at Emily. "If they do, there's
      one among them knows my thoughts, and feels for me. Good-by, miss&mdash;and
      don't think worse of me than I deserve."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily went back to the parlor. The only resource left was to plead with
      Francine for mercy to Mrs. Ellmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really mean to give it up?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To give up&mdash;what? 'Pumping,' as that obstinate old creature calls
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily persisted. "Don't worry the poor old soul! However strangely she may
      have left my aunt and me her motives are kind and good&mdash;I am sure of
      that. Will you let her keep her harmless little secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe you, Francine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you? I am like Cecilia&mdash;I am getting hungry. Shall we have
      some lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hard-hearted creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does that mean&mdash;no luncheon until I have owned the truth? Suppose <i>you</i>
      own the truth? I won't tell Mrs. Ellmother that you have betrayed her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the last time, Francine&mdash;I know no more of it than you do. If
      you persist in taking your own view, you as good as tell me I lie; and you
      will oblige me to leave the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Francine's obstinacy was compelled to give way, so far as appearances
      went. Still possessed by the delusion that Emily was deceiving her, she
      was now animated by a stronger motive than mere curiosity. Her sense of
      her own importance imperatively urged her to prove that she was not a
      person who could be deceived with impunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," she said with humility. "But I must positively have
      it out with Mrs. Ellmother. She has been more than a match for me&mdash;my
      turn next. I mean to get the better of her; and I shall succeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already told you, Francine&mdash;you will fail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I am a dunce, and I don't deny it. But let me tell you one
      thing. I haven't lived all my life in the West Indies, among black
      servants, without learning something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More, my clever friend, than you are likely to guess. In the meantime,
      don't forget the duties of hospitality. Ring the bell for luncheon."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. LADY DORIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The arrival of Miss Ladd, some time before she had been expected,
      interrupted the two girls at a critical moment. She had hurried over her
      business in London, eager to pass the rest of the day with her favorite
      pupil. Emily's affectionate welcome was, in some degree at least, inspired
      by a sensation of relief. To feel herself in the embrace of the
      warm-hearted schoolmistress was like finding a refuge from Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour of departure arrived, Miss Ladd invited Emily to Brighton
      for the second time. "On the last occasion, my dear, you wrote me an
      excuse; I won't be treated in that way again. If you can't return with us
      now, come to-morrow." She added in a whisper, "Otherwise, I shall think
      you include <i>me</i> in your dislike of Francine."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting this. It was arranged that Emily should go to
      Brighton on the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by herself, her thoughts might have reverted to Mrs. Ellmother's
      doubtful prospects, and to Francine's strange allusion to her life in the
      West Indies, but for the arrival of two letters by the afternoon post. The
      handwriting on one of them was unknown to her. She opened that one first.
      It was an answer to the letter of apology which she had persisted in
      writing to Mrs. Rook. Happily for herself, Alban's influence had not been
      without its effect, after his departure. She had written kindly&mdash;but
      she had written briefly at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook's reply presented a nicely compounded mixture of gratitude and
      grief. The gratitude was addressed to Emily as a matter of course. The
      grief related to her "excellent master." Sir Jervis's strength had
      suddenly failed. His medical attendant, being summoned, had expressed no
      surprise. "My patient is over seventy years of age," the doctor remarked.
      "He will sit up late at night, writing his book; and he refuses to take
      exercise, till headache and giddiness force him to try the fresh air. As
      the necessary result, he has broken down at last. It may end in paralysis,
      or it may end in death." Reporting this expression of medical opinion,
      Mrs. Rook's letter glided imperceptibly from respectful sympathy to modest
      regard for her own interests in the future. It might be the sad fate of
      her husband and herself to be thrown on the world again. If necessity
      brought them to London, would "kind Miss Emily grant her the honor of an
      interview, and favor a poor unlucky woman with a word of advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She may pervert your letter to some use of her own, which you may have
      reason to regret." Did Emily remember Alban's warning words? No: she
      accepted Mrs. Rook's reply as a gratifying tribute to the justice of her
      own opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having proposed to write to Alban, feeling penitently that she had been in
      the wrong, she was now readier than ever to send him a letter, feeling
      compassionately that she had been in the right. Besides, it was due to the
      faithful friend, who was still working for her in the reading room, that
      he should be informed of Sir Jervis's illness. Whether the old man lived
      or whether he died, his literary labors were fatally interrupted in either
      case; and one of the consequences would be the termination of her
      employment at the Museum. Although the second of the two letters which she
      had received was addressed to her in Cecilia's handwriting, Emily waited
      to read it until she had first written to Alban. "He will come to-morrow,"
      she thought; "and we shall both make apologies. I shall regret that I was
      angry with him and he will regret that he was mistaken in his judgment of
      Mrs. Rook. We shall be as good friends again as ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this happy frame of mind she opened Cecilia's letter. It was full of
      good news from first to last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invalid sister had made such rapid progress toward recovery that the
      travelers had arranged to set forth on their journey back to England in a
      fortnight. "My one regret," Cecilia added, "is the parting with Lady
      Doris. She and her husband are going to Genoa, where they will embark in
      Lord Janeaway's yacht for a cruise in the Mediterranean. When we have said
      that miserable word good-by&mdash;oh, Emily, what a hurry I shall be in to
      get back to you! Those allusions to your lonely life are so dreadful, my
      dear, that I have destroyed your letter; it is enough to break one's heart
      only to look at it. When once I get to London, there shall be no more
      solitude for my poor afflicted friend. Papa will be free from his
      parliamentary duties in August&mdash;and he has promised to have the house
      full of delightful people to meet you. Who do you think will be one of our
      guests? He is illustrious; he is fascinating; he deserves a line all to
      himself, thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Reverend Miles Mirabel!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Doris has discovered that the country parsonage, in which this
      brilliant clergyman submits to exile, is only twelve miles away from our
      house. She has written to Mr. Mirabel to introduce me, and to mention the
      date of my return. We will have some fun with the popular preacher&mdash;we
      will both fall in love with him together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anybody to whom you would like me to send an invitation? Shall
      we have Mr. Alban Morris? Now I know how kindly he took care of you at the
      railway station, your good opinion of him is my opinion. Your letter also
      mentions a doctor. Is he nice? and do you think he will let me eat pastry,
      if we have him too? I am so overflowing with hospitality (all for your
      sake) that I am ready to invite anybody, and everybody, to cheer you and
      make you happy. Would you like to meet Miss Ladd and the whole school?
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to our amusements, make your mind easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to a distinct understanding with Papa that we are to have
      dances every evening&mdash;except when we try a little concert as a
      change. Private theatricals are to follow, when we want another change
      after the dancing and the music. No early rising; no fixed hour for
      breakfast; everything that is most exquisitely delicious at dinner&mdash;and,
      to crown all, your room next to mine, for delightful midnight gossipings,
      when we ought to be in bed. What do you say, darling, to the programme?
    </p>
    <p>
      "A last piece of news&mdash;and I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have actually had a proposal of marriage, from a young gentleman who
      sits opposite me at the table d'hote! When I tell you that he has white
      eyelashes, and red hands, and such enormous front teeth that he can't shut
      his mouth, you will not need to be told that I refused him. This
      vindictive person has abused me ever since, in the most shameful manner. I
      heard him last night, under my window, trying to set one of his friends
      against me. 'Keep clear of her, my dear fellow; she's the most heartless
      creature living.' The friend took my part; he said, 'I don't agree with
      you; the young lady is a person of great sensibility.' 'Nonsense!' says my
      amiable lover; 'she eats too much&mdash;her sensibility is all stomach.'
      There's a wretch for you. What a shameful advantage to take of sitting
      opposite to me at dinner! Good-by, my love, till we meet soon, and are as
      happy together as the day is long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily kissed the signature. At that moment of all others, Cecilia was such
      a refreshing contrast to Francine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before putting the letter away, she looked again at that part of it which
      mentioned Lady Doris's introduction of Cecilia to Mr. Mirabel. "I don't
      feel the slightest interest in Mr. Mirabel," she thought, smiling as the
      idea occurred to her; "and I need never have known him, but for Lady Doris&mdash;who
      is a perfect stranger to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had just placed the letter in her desk, when a visitor was announced.
      Doctor Allday presented himself (in a hurry as usual).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another patient waiting?" Emily asked mischievously. "No time to spare,
      again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a moment," the old gentleman answered. "Have you heard from Mrs.
      Ellmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say you have answered her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done better than that, doctor&mdash;I have seen her this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And consented to be her reference, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How well you know me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday was a philosopher: he kept his temper. "Just what I might
      have expected," he said. "Eve and the apple! Only forbid a woman to do
      anything, and she does it directly&mdash;be cause you have forbidden her.
      I'll try the other way with you now, Miss Emily. There was something else
      that I meant to have forbidden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I make a special request?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, write to Mrs. Rook! I beg and entreat of you, write to Mrs.
      Rook!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's playful manner suddenly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignoring the doctor's little outbreak of humor, she waited in grave
      surprise, until it was his pleasure to explain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday, on his side, ignored the ominous change in Emily; he went
      on as pleasantly as ever. "Mr. Morris and I have had a long talk about
      you, my dear. Mr. Morris is a capital fellow; I recommend him as a
      sweetheart. I also back him in the matter of Mrs. Rook.&mdash;What's the
      matter now? You're as red as a rose. Temper again, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hatred of meanness!" Emily answered indignantly. "I despise a man who
      plots, behind my back, to get another man to help him. Oh, how I have been
      mistaken in Alban Morris!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how little you know of the best friend you have!" cried the doctor,
      imitating her. "Girls are all alike; the only man they can understand, is
      the man who flatters them. <i>Will</i> you oblige me by writing to Mrs.
      Rook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily made an attempt to match the doctor, with his own weapons. "Your
      little joke comes too late," she said satirically. "There is Mrs. Rook's
      answer. Read it, and&mdash;" she checked herself, even in her anger she
      was incapable of speaking ungenerously to the old man who had so warmly
      befriended her. "I won't say to <i>you</i>," she resumed, "what I might
      have said to another person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I say it for you?" asked the incorrigible doctor. "'Read it, and be
      ashamed of yourself'&mdash;That was what you had in your mind, isn't it?
      Anything to please you, my dear." He put on his spectacles, read the
      letter, and handed it back to Emily with an impenetrable countenance.
      "What do you think of my new spectacles?" he asked, as he took the glasses
      off his nose. "In the experience of thirty years, I have had three
      grateful patients." He put the spectacles back in the case. "This comes
      from the third. Very gratifying&mdash;very gratifying."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's sense of humor was not the uppermost sense in her at that moment.
      She pointed with a peremptory forefinger to Mrs. Rook's letter. "Have you
      nothing to say about this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had so little to say about it that he was able to express
      himself in one word:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humbug!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat&mdash;nodded kindly to Emily&mdash;and hurried away to
      feverish pulses waiting to be felt, and to furred tongues that were
      ashamed to show themselves.

      CHAPTER XXXI. MOIRA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Alban presented himself the next morning, the hours of the night had
      exercised their tranquilizing influence over Emily. She remembered
      sorrowfully how Doctor Allday had disturbed her belief in the man who
      loved her; no feeling of irritation remained. Alban noticed that her
      manner was unusually subdued; she received him with her customary grace,
      but not with her customary smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not well?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a little out of spirits," she replied. "A disappointment&mdash;that
      is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a moment, apparently in the expectation that she might tell him
      what the disappointment was. She remained silent, and she looked away from
      him. Was he in any way answerable for the depression of spirits to which
      she alluded? The doubt occurred to him&mdash;but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you have received my letter?" she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come here to thank you for your letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was my duty to tell you of Sir Jervis's illness; I deserve no thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have written to me so kindly," Alban reminded her; "you have referred
      to our difference of opinion, the last time I was here, so gently and so
      forgivingly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had written a little later," she interposed, "the tone of my letter
      might have been less agreeable to you. I happened to send it to the post,
      before I received a visit from a friend of yours&mdash;a friend who had
      something to say to me after consulting with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean Doctor Allday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you wished him to say. He did his best; he was as obstinate and
      unfeeling as you could possibly wish him to be; but he was too late. I
      have written to Mrs. Rook, and I have received a reply." She spoke sadly,
      not angrily&mdash;and pointed to the letter lying on her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban understood: he looked at her in despair. "Is that wretched woman
      doomed to set us at variance every time we meet!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily silently held out the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused to take it. "The wrong you have done me is not to be set right
      in that way," he said. "You believe the doctor's visit was arranged
      between us. I never knew that he intended to call on you; I had no
      interest in sending him here&mdash;and I must not interfere again between
      you and Mrs. Rook."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will understand me when I tell you how my conversation with Doctor
      Allday ended. I have done with interference; I have done with advice.
      Whatever my doubts may be, all further effort on my part to justify them&mdash;all
      further inquiries, no matter in what direction&mdash;are at an end: I made
      the sacrifice, for your sake. No! I must repeat what you said to me just
      now; I deserve no thanks. What I have done, has been done in deference to
      Doctor Allday&mdash;against my own convictions; in spite of my own fears.
      Ridiculous convictions! ridiculous fears! Men with morbid minds are their
      own tormentors. It doesn't matter how I suffer, so long as you are at
      ease. I shall never thwart you or vex you again. Have you a better opinion
      of me now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made the best of all answers&mdash;she gave him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I kiss it?" he asked, as timidly as if he had been a boy addressing
      his first sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was half inclined to laugh, and half inclined to cry. "Yes, if you
      like," she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you let me come and see you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gladly&mdash;when I return to London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to Brighton this afternoon, to stay with Miss Ladd."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to lose her, on the happy day when they understood each other
      at last. An expression of disappointment passed over his face. He rose,
      and walked restlessly to the window. "Miss Ladd?" he repeated, turning to
      Emily as if an idea had struck him. "Did I hear, at the school, that Miss
      de Sor was to spend the holidays under the care of Miss Ladd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same young lady," he went on, "who paid you a visit yesterday
      morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same."
    </p>
    <p>
      That haunting distrust of the future, which he had first betrayed and then
      affected to ridicule, exercised its depressing influence over his better
      sense. He was unreasonable enough to feel doubtful of Francine, simply
      because she was a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss de Sor is a new friend of yours," he said. "Do you like her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an easy question to answer&mdash;without entering into
      particulars which Emily's delicacy of feeling warned her to avoid. "I must
      know a little more of Miss de Sor," she said, "before I can decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's misgivings were naturally encouraged by this evasive reply. He
      began to regret having left the cottage, on the previous day, when he had
      heard that Emily was engaged. He might have sent in his card, and might
      have been admitted. It was an opportunity lost of observing Francine. On
      the morning of her first day at school, when they had accidentally met at
      the summer house, she had left a disagreeable impression on his mind.
      Ought he to allow his opinion to be influenced by this circumstance? or
      ought he to follow Emily's prudent example, and suspend judgment until he
      knew a little more of Francine?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is any day fixed for your return to London?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," she said; "I hardly know how long my visit will be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In little more than a fortnight," he continued, "I shall return to my
      classes&mdash;they will be dreary classes, without you. Miss de Sor goes
      back to the school with Miss Ladd, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was at a loss to account for the depression in his looks and tones,
      while he was making these unimportant inquiries. She tried to rouse him by
      speaking lightly in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss de Sor returns in quite a new character; she is to be a guest
      instead of a pupil. Do you wish to be better acquainted with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said grave ly, "now I know that she is a friend of yours." He
      returned to his place near her. "A pleasant visit makes the days pass
      quickly," he resumed. "You may remain at Brighton longer than you
      anticipate; and we may not meet again for some time to come. If anything
      happens&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean anything serious?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! I only mean&mdash;if I can be of any service. In that case, will
      you write to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him anxiously. He had completely failed to hide from her the
      uneasy state of his mind: a man less capable of concealment of feeling
      never lived. "You are anxious, and out of spirits," she said gently. "Is
      it my fault?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your fault? oh, don't think that! I have my dull days and my bright days&mdash;and
      just now my barometer is down at dull." His voice faltered, in spite of
      his efforts to control it; he gave up the struggle, and took his hat to
      go. "Do you remember, Emily, what I once said to you in the garden at the
      school? I still believe there is a time of fulfillment to come in our
      lives." He suddenly checked himself, as if there had been something more
      in his mind to which he hesitated to give expression&mdash;and held out
      his hand to bid her good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My memory of what you said in the garden is better than yours," she
      reminded him. "You said 'Happen what may in the interval, I trust the
      future.' Do you feel the same trust still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed&mdash;drew her to him gently&mdash;and kissed her on the
      forehead. Was that his own reply? She was not calm enough to ask him the
      question: it remained in her thoughts for some time after he had gone.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         ........
</pre>
    <p>
      On the same day Emily was at Brighton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine happened to be alone in the drawing-room. Her first proceeding,
      when Emily was shown in, was to stop the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you taken my letter to the post?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't matter." She dismissed the servant by a gesture, and burst
      into such effusive hospitality that she actually insisted on kissing
      Emily. "Do you know what I have been doing?" she said. "I have been
      writing to Cecilia&mdash;directing to the care of her father, at the House
      of Commons. I stupidly forgot that you would be able to give me the right
      address in Switzerland. You don't object, I hope, to my making myself
      agreeable to our dear, beautiful, greedy girl? It is of such importance to
      me to surround myself with influential friends&mdash;and, of course, I
      have given her your love. Don't look disgusted! Come, and see your room.&mdash;Oh,
      never mind Miss Ladd. You will see her when she wakes. Ill? Is that sort
      of old woman ever ill? She's only taking her nap after bathing. Bathing in
      the sea, at her age! How she must frighten the fishes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen her own bed-chamber, Emily was next introduced to the room
      occupied by Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      One object that she noticed in it caused her some little surprise&mdash;not
      unmingled with disgust. She discovered on the toilet-table a coarsely
      caricatured portrait of Mrs. Ellmother. It was a sketch in pencil&mdash;wretchedly
      drawn; but spitefully successful as a likeness. "I didn't know you were an
      artist," Emily remarked, with an ironical emphasis on the last word.
      Francine laughed scornfully&mdash;crumpled the drawing up in her hand&mdash;and
      threw it into the waste-paper basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You satirical creature!" she burst out gayly. "If you had lived a dull
      life at St. Domingo, you would have taken to spoiling paper too. I might
      really have turned out an artist, if I had been clever and industrious
      like you. As it was, I learned a little drawing&mdash;and got tired of it.
      I tried modeling in wax&mdash;and got tired of it. Who do you think was my
      teacher? One of our slaves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A slave!" Emily exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;a mulatto, if you wish me to be particular; the daughter of an
      English father and a negro mother. In her young time (at least she said so
      herself) she was quite a beauty, in her particular style. Her master's
      favorite; he educated her himself. Besides drawing and painting, and
      modeling in wax, she could sing and play&mdash;all the accomplishments
      thrown away on a slave! When her owner died, my uncle bought her at the
      sale of the property."
    </p>
    <p>
      A word of natural compassion escaped Emily&mdash;to Francine's surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, you needn't pity her! Sappho (that was her name) fetched a
      high price, even when she was no longer young. She came to us, by
      inheritance, with the estates and the rest of it; and took a fancy to me,
      when she found out I didn't get on well with my father and mother. 'I owe
      it to <i>my</i> father and mother,' she used to say, 'that I am a slave.
      When I see affectionate daughters, it wrings my heart.' Sappho was a
      strange compound. A woman with a white side to her character, and a black
      side. For weeks together, she would be a civilized being. Then she used to
      relapse, and become as complete a negress as her mother. At the risk of
      her life she stole away, on those occasions, into the interior of the
      island, and looked on, in hiding, at the horrid witchcrafts and idolatries
      of the blacks; they would have murdered a half-blood, prying into their
      ceremonies, if they had discovered her. I followed her once, so far as I
      dared. The frightful yellings and drummings in the darkness of the forests
      frightened me. The blacks suspected her, and it came to my ears. I gave
      her the warning that saved her life (I don't know what I should have done
      without Sappho to amuse me!); and, from that time, I do believe the
      curious creature loved me. You see I can speak generously even of a
      slave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder you didn't bring her with you to England," Emily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place," Francine answered, "she was my father's property,
      not mine. In the second place, she's dead. Poisoned, as the other
      half-bloods supposed, by some enemy among the blacks. She said herself,
      she was under a spell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did she mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was not interested enough in the subject to explain. "Stupid
      superstition, my dear. The negro side of Sappho was uppermost when she was
      dying&mdash;there is the explanation. Be off with you! I hear the old
      woman on the stairs. Meet her before she can come in here. My bedroom is
      my only refuge from Miss Ladd."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the last day in the week, Emily had a little talk in
      private with her old schoolmistress. Miss Ladd listened to what she had to
      say of Mrs. Ellmother, and did her best to relieve Emily's anxieties. "I
      think you are mistaken, my child, in supposing that Francine is in
      earnest. It is her great fault that she is hardly ever in earnest. You can
      trust to my discretion; leave the rest to your aunt's old servant and to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother arrived, punctual to the appointed time. She was shown into
      Miss Ladd's own room. Francine&mdash;ostentatiously resolved to take no
      personal part in the affair&mdash;went for a walk. Emily waited to hear
      the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long interval, Miss Ladd returned to the drawing-room, and
      announced that she had sanctioned the engagement of Mrs. Ellmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have considered your wishes, in this respect," she said. "It is
      arranged that a week's notice, on either side, shall end the term of
      service, after the first month. I cannot feel justified in doing more than
      that. Mrs. Ellmother is such a respectable woman; she is so well known to
      you, and she was so long in your aunt's service, that I am bound to
      consider the importance of securing a person who is exactly fitted to
      attend on such a girl as Francine. In one word, I can trust Mrs.
      Ellmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When does she enter on her service?" Emily inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the day after we return to the school," Miss Ladd replied. "You will
      be glad to see her, I am sure. I will send her here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word more before you go," Emily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ask her why she left my aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear child, a woman who has been five-and-twenty years in one place is
      entitled to keep her own secrets. I understand that she had her reasons,
      and that she doesn't think it necessary to mention them to anybody. Never
      trust people by halves&mdash;especially when they are people like Mrs.
      Ellmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late now to raise any objections. Emily felt relieved, rather
      than disappointed, on discovering that Mrs. Ellmother was in a hurry to
      get back to London by the next train. Sh e had found an opportunity of
      letting her lodgings; and she was eager to conclude the bargain. "You see
      I couldn't say Yes," she explained, "till I knew whether I was to get this
      new place or not&mdash;and the person wants to go in tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stopped her at the door. "Promise to write and tell me how you get
      on with Miss de Sor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that, miss, as if you didn't feel hopeful about me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it, because I feel interested about you. Promise to write."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother promised, and hastened away. Emily looked after her from
      the window, as long as she was in view. "I wish I could feel sure of
      Francine!" she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?" asked the hard voice of Francine, speaking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not in Emily's nature to shrink from a plain reply. She completed
      her half-formed thought without a moment's hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could feel sure," she answered, "that you will be kind to Mrs.
      Ellmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you afraid I shall make her life one scene of torment?" Francine
      inquired. "How can I answer for myself? I can't look into the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For once in your life, can you be in earnest?" Emily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For once in your life, can you take a joke?" Francine replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily said no more. She privately resolved to shorten her visit to
      Brighton.

      CHAPTER XXXII. IN THE GRAY ROOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The house inhabited by Miss Ladd and her pupils had been built, in the
      early part of the present century, by a wealthy merchant&mdash;proud of
      his money, and eager to distinguish himself as the owner of the largest
      country seat in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his death, Miss Ladd had taken Netherwoods (as the place was
      called), finding her own house insufficient for the accommodation of the
      increasing number of her pupils. A lease was granted to her on moderate
      terms. Netherwoods failed to attract persons of distinction in search of a
      country residence. The grounds were beautiful; but no landed property&mdash;not
      even a park&mdash;was attached to the house. Excepting the few acres on
      which the building stood, the surrounding land belonged to a retired naval
      officer of old family, who resented the attempt of a merchant of low birth
      to assume the position of a gentleman. No matter what proposals might be
      made to the admiral, he refused them all. The privilege of shooting was
      not one of the attractions offered to tenants; the country presented no
      facilities for hunting; and the only stream in the neighborhood was not
      preserved. In consequence of these drawbacks, the merchant's
      representatives had to choose between a proposal to use Netherwoods as a
      lunatic asylum, or to accept as tenant the respectable mistress of a
      fashionable and prosperous school. They decided in favor of Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contemplated change in Francine's position was accomplished, in that
      vast house, without inconvenience. There were rooms unoccupied, even when
      the limit assigned to the number of pupils had been reached. On the
      re-opening of the school, Francine was offered her choice between two
      rooms on one of the upper stories, and two rooms on the ground floor. She
      chose these last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sitting-room and bedroom, situated at the back of the house,
      communicated with each other. The sitting-room, ornamented with a pretty
      paper of delicate gray, and furnished with curtains of the same color, had
      been accordingly named, "The Gray Room." It had a French window, which
      opened on the terrace overlooking the garden and the grounds. Some fine
      old engravings from the grand landscapes of Claude (part of a collection
      of prints possessed by Miss Ladd's father) hung on the walls. The carpet
      was in harmony with the curtains; and the furniture was of light-colored
      wood, which helped the general effect of subdued brightness that made the
      charm of the room. "If you are not happy here," Miss Ladd said, "I despair
      of you." And Francine answered, "Yes, it's very pretty, but I wish it was
      not so small."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the twelfth of August the regular routine of the school was resumed.
      Alban Morris found two strangers in his class, to fill the vacancies left
      by Emily and Cecilia. Mrs. Ellmother was duly established in her new
      place. She produced an unfavorable impression in the servants' hall&mdash;not
      (as the handsome chief housemaid explained) because she was ugly and old,
      but because she was "a person who didn't talk." The prejudice against
      habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as
      inveterate as the prejudice against red hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, on that first day of renewed studies&mdash;while the girls
      were in the grounds, after tea&mdash;Francine had at last completed the
      arrangement of her rooms, and had dismissed Mrs. Ellmother (kept hard at
      work since the morning) to take a little rest. Standing alone at her
      window, the West Indian heiress wondered what she had better do next. She
      glanced at the girls on the lawn, and decided that they were unworthy of
      serious notice, on the part of a person so specially favored as herself.
      She turned sidewise, and looked along the length of the terrace. At the
      far end a tall man was slowly pacing to and fro, with his head down and
      his hands in his pockets. Francine recognized the rude drawing-master, who
      had torn up his view of the village, after she had saved it from being
      blown into the pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped out on the terrace, and called to him. He stopped, and looked
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want me?" he called back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She advanced a little to meet him, and offered encouragement under the
      form of a hard smile. Although his manners might be unpleasant, he had
      claims on the indulgence of a young lady, who was at a loss how to employ
      her idle time. In the first place, he was a man. In the second place, he
      was not as old as the music-master, or as ugly as the dancing-master. In
      the third place, he was an admirer of Emily; and the opportunity of trying
      to shake his allegiance by means of a flirtation, in Emily's absence, was
      too good an opportunity to be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember how rude you were to me, on the day when you were
      sketching in the summer-house?" Francine asked with snappish playfulness.
      "I expect you to make yourself agreeable this time&mdash;I am going to pay
      you a compliment."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, with exasperating composure, to hear what the proposed
      compliment might be. The furrow between his eyebrows looked deeper than
      ever. There were signs of secret trouble in that dark face, so grimly and
      so resolutely composed. The school, without Emily, presented the severest
      trial of endurance that he had encountered, since the day when he had been
      deserted and disgraced by his affianced wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an artist," Francine proceeded, "and therefore a person of taste.
      I want to have your opinion of my sitting-room. Criticism is invited; pray
      come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be unwilling to accept the invitation&mdash;then altered his
      mind, and followed Francine. She had visited Emily; she was perhaps in a
      fair way to become Emily's friend. He remembered that he had already lost
      an opportunity of studying her character, and&mdash;if he saw the
      necessity&mdash;of warning Emily not to encourage the advances of Miss de
      Sor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pretty," he remarked, looking round the room&mdash;without appearing
      to care for anything in it, except the prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was bent on fascinating him. She raised her eyebrows and lifted
      her hands, in playful remonstrance. "Do remember it's <i>my</i> room," she
      said, "and take some little interest in it, for <i>my</i> sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want me to say?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and sit down by me." She made room for him on the sofa. Her one
      favorite aspiration&mdash;the longing to excite envy in others&mdash;expressed
      itself in her next words. "Say something pretty," she answered; "say you
      would like to have such a room as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to have your prints," he remarked. "Will that do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wouldn't do&mdash;from anybody else. Ah, Mr. Morris, I know why you
      are not as nice as you might be! You are not happy. The school has lost
      its one attraction, in losing our dear Emily. You feel it&mdash;I know you
      feel it." She assisted this expression of sympathy to produce the right
      effect by a sigh. "What would I not give to inspire such devotion as
      yours! I don't envy Emily; I only wish&mdash;" She paused in confusion,
      and opened her fan. "Isn't it pretty?" she said, with an ostentatious
      appearance of changing the subject. Alban behaved like a monster; he began
      to talk of the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think this is the hottest day we have had," he said; "no wonder you
      want your fan. Netherwoods is an airless place at this season of the
      year."
    </p>
    <p>
      She controlled her temper. "I do indeed feel the heat," she admitted, with
      a resignation which gently reproved him; "it is so heavy and oppressive
      here after Brighton. Perhaps my sad life, far away from home and friends,
      makes me sensitive to trifles. Do you think so, Mr. Morris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The merciless man said he thought it was the situation of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Ladd took the place in the spring," he continued; "and only
      discovered the one objection to it some months afterward. We are in the
      highest part of the valley here&mdash;but, you see, it's a valley
      surrounded by hills; and on three sides the hills are near us. All very
      well in winter; but in summer I have heard of girls in this school so out
      of health in the relaxing atmosphere that they have been sent home again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine suddenly showed an interest in what he was saying. If he had
      cared to observe her closely, he might have noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that the girls were really ill?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. They slept badly&mdash;lost appetite&mdash;started at trifling
      noises. In short, their nerves were out of order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did they get well again at home, in another air?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt of it," he answered, beginning to get weary of the subject.
      "May I look at your books?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine's interest in the influence of different atmospheres on health
      was not exhausted yet. "Do you know where the girls lived when they were
      at home?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know where one of them lived. She was the best pupil I ever had&mdash;and
      I remember she lived in Yorkshire." He was so weary of the idle curiosity&mdash;as
      it appeared to him&mdash;which persisted in asking trifling questions,
      that he left his seat, and crossed the room. "May I look at your books?"
      he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was suspended for a while. The lady thought, "I should
      like to box his ears!" The gentleman thought, "She's only an inquisitive
      fool after all!" His examination of her books confirmed him in the
      delusion that there was really nothing in Francine's character which
      rendered it necessary to caution Emily against the advances of her new
      friend. Turning away from the book-case, he made the first excuse that
      occurred to him for putting an end to the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must beg you to let me return to my duties, Miss de Sor. I have to
      correct the young ladies' drawings, before they begin again to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine's wounded vanity made a last expiring attempt to steal the heart
      of Emily's lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remind me that I have a favor to ask," she said. "I don't attend the
      other classes&mdash;but I should so like to join <i>your</i> class! May
      I?" She looked up at him with a languishing appearance of entreaty which
      sorely tried Alban's capacity to keep his face in serious order. He
      acknowledged the compliment paid to him in studiously commonplace terms,
      and got a little nearer to the open window. Francine's obstinacy was not
      conquered yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My education has been sadly neglected," she continued; "but I have had
      some little instruction in drawing. You will not find me so ignorant as
      some of the other girls." She waited a little, anticipating a few
      complimentary words. Alban waited also&mdash;in silence. "I shall look
      forward with pleasure to my lessons under such an artist as yourself," she
      went on, and waited again, and was disappointed again. "Perhaps," she
      resumed, "I may become your favorite pupil&mdash;Who knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not much to say, when he spoke at last&mdash;but it was enough to
      encourage Francine. She called him "dear Mr. Morris"; she pleaded for
      permission to take her first lesson immediately; she clasped her hands&mdash;"Please
      say Yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say Yes, till you have complied with the rules."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they <i>your</i> rules?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes expressed the readiest submission&mdash;in that case. He entirely
      failed to see it: he said they were Miss Ladd's rules&mdash;and wished her
      good-evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him, walking away down the terrace. How was he paid? Did he
      receive a yearly salary, or did he get a little extra money for each new
      pupil who took drawing lessons? In this last case, Francine saw her
      opportunity of being even with him "You brute! Catch me attending your
      class!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. RECOLLECTIONS OF ST. DOMINGO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night was oppressively hot. Finding it impossible to sleep, Francine
      lay quietly in her bed, thinking. The subject of her reflections was a
      person who occupied the humble position of her new servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother looked wretchedly ill. Mrs. Ellmother had told Emily that
      her object, in returning to domestic service, was to try if change would
      relieve her from the oppression of her own thoughts. Mrs. Ellmother
      believed in vulgar superstitions which declared Friday to be an unlucky
      day; and which recommended throwing a pinch over your left shoulder, if
      you happened to spill the salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In themselves, these were trifling recollections. But they assumed a
      certain importance, derived from the associations which they called forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reminded Francine, by some mental process which she was at a loss to
      trace, of Sappho the slave, and of her life at St. Domingo.
    </p>
    <p>
      She struck a light, and unlocked her writing desk. From one of the drawers
      she took out an old household account-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first page contained some entries, relating to domestic expenses, in
      her own handwriting. They recalled one of her efforts to occupy her idle
      time, by relieving her mother of the cares of housekeeping. For a day or
      two, she had persevered&mdash;and then she had ceased to feel any interest
      in her new employment. The remainder of the book was completely filled up,
      in a beautifully clear handwriting, beginning on the second page. A title
      had been found for the manuscript by Francine. She had written at the top
      of the page: <i>Sappho's Nonsense</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading the first few sentences she rapidly turned over the leaves,
      and stopped at a blank space near the end of the book. Here again she had
      added a title. This time it implied a compliment to the writer: the page
      was headed: <i>Sappho's Sense</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read this latter part of the manuscript with the closest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I entreat my kind and dear young mistress not to suppose that I believe
      in witchcraft&mdash;after such an education as I have received. When I
      wrote down, at your biding, all that I had told you by word of mouth, I
      cannot imagine what delusion possessed me. You say I have a negro side to
      my character, which I inherit from my mother. Did you mean this, dear
      mistress, as a joke? I am almost afraid it is sometimes not far off from
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me be careful, however, to avoid leading you into a mistake. It is
      really true that the man-slave I spoke of did pine and die, after the
      spell had been cast on him by my witch-mother's image of wax. But I ought
      also to have told you that circumstances favored the working of the spell:
      the fatal end was not brought about by supernatural means.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor wretch was not in good health at the time; and our owner had
      occasion to employ him in the valley of the island far inland. I have been
      told, and can well believe, that the climate there is different from the
      climate on the coast&mdash;in which the unfortunate slave had been
      accustomed to live. The overseer wouldn't believe him when he said the
      valley air would be his death&mdash;and the negroes, who might otherwise
      have helped him, all avoided a man whom they knew to be under a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, you see, accounts for what might appear incredible to civilized
      persons. If you will do me a favor, you will burn this little book, as
      soon as you have read what I have written here. If my request is not
      granted, I can only implore you to let no eyes but your own see these
      pages. My life might be in danger if the blacks knew what I have now told
      you, in the interests of truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine closed the book, and locked it up again in her desk. "Now I
      know," she said to herself, "what reminded me of St. Domingo."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Francine rang her bell the next morning, so long a time elapsed
      without producing an answer that she began to think of sending one of the
      house-servants to make inquiries. Before she could decide, Mrs. Ellmother
      presented herself, and offered her apologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the first time I have overslept myself, miss, since I was a girl.
      Please to excuse me, it shan't happen again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you find that the air here makes you drowsy?" Francine asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother shook her head. "I didn't get to sleep," she said, "till
      morning, and so I was too heavy to be up in time. But air has got nothing
      to do with it. Gentlefolks may have their whims and fancies. All air is
      the same to people like me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You enjoy good health, Mrs. Ellmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, miss? I have never had a doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! That's your opinion of doctors, is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't have anything to do with them&mdash;if that's what you mean by my
      opinion," Mrs. Ellmother answered doggedly. "How will you have your hair
      done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same as yesterday. Have you seen anything of Miss Emily? She went
      back to London the day after you left us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't been in London. I'm thankful to say my lodgings are let to a
      good tenant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then where have you lived, while you were waiting to come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had only one place to go to, miss; I went to the village where I was
      born. A friend found a corner for me. Ah, dear heart, it's a pleasant
      place, there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A place like this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord help you! As little like this as chalk is to cheese. A fine big
      moor, miss, in Cumberland, without a tree in sight&mdash;look where you
      may. Something like a wind, I can tell you, when it takes to blowing
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you never been in this part of the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I! When I left the North, my new mistress took me to Canada. Talk
      about air! If there was anything in it, the people in <i>that</i> air
      ought to live to be a hundred. I liked Canada."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who was your next mistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Mrs. Ellmother had been ready enough to talk. Had she failed to
      hear what Francine had just said to her? or had she some reason for
      feeling reluctant to answer? In any case, a spirit of taciturnity took
      sudden possession of her&mdash;she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine (as usual) persisted. "Was your next place in service with Miss
      Emily's aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did the old lady always live in London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What part of the country did she live in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Among the hop gardens?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what other part, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isle of Thanet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Near the sea coast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Francine could insist no longer: Mrs. Ellmother's reserve had beaten
      her&mdash;for that day at least. "Go into the hall," she said, "and see if
      there are any letters for me in the rack."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a letter bearing the Swiss postmark. Simple Cecilia was
      flattered and delighted by the charming manner in which Francine had
      written to her. She looked forward with impatience to the time when their
      present acquaintance might ripen into friendship. Would "Dear Miss de Sor"
      waive all ceremony, and consent to be a guest (later in the autumn) at her
      father's house? Circumstances connected with her sister's health would
      delay their return to England for a little while. By the end of the month
      she hoped to be at home again, and to hear if Francine was disengaged. Her
      address, in England, was Monksmoor Park, Hants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having read the letter, Francine drew a moral from it: "There is great use
      in a fool, when one knows how to manage her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having little appetite for her breakfast, she tried the experiment of a
      walk on the terrace. Alban Morris was right; the air at Netherwoods, in
      the summer time, <i>was</i> relaxing. The morning mist still hung over the
      lowest part of the valley, between the village and the hills beyond. A
      little exercise produced a feeling of fatigue. Francine returned to her
      room, and trifled with her tea and toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her next proceeding was to open her writing-desk, and look into the old
      account-book once more. While it lay open on her lap, she recalled what
      had passed that morning, between Mrs. Ellmother and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman had been born and bred in the North, on an open moor. She
      had been removed to the keen air of Canada when she left her birthplace.
      She had been in service after that, on the breezy eastward coast of Kent.
      Would the change to the climate of Netherwoods produce any effect on Mrs.
      Ellmother? At her age, and with her seasoned constitution, would she feel
      it as those school-girls had felt it&mdash;especially that one among them,
      who lived in the bracing air of the North, the air of Yorkshire?
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary of solitary thinking on one subject, Francine returned to the
      terrace with a vague idea of finding something to amuse her&mdash;that is
      to say, something she could turn into ridicule&mdash;if she joined the
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Mrs. Ellmother answered her mistress's bell without
      delay. "You have slept better, this time?" Francine said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss. When I did get to sleep I was troubled by dreams. Another bad
      night&mdash;and no mistake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect your mind is not quite at ease," Francine suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you suspect that, if you please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You talked, when I met you at Miss Emily's, of wanting to get away from
      your own thoughts. Has the change to this place helped you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It hasn't helped me as I expected. Some people's thoughts stick fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remorseful thoughts?" Francine inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother held up her forefinger, and shook it with a gesture of
      reproof. "I thought we agreed, miss, that there was to be no pumping."
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of the toilet proceeded in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed. During an interval in the labors of the school, Miss Ladd
      knocked at the door of Francine's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to speak to you, my dear, about Mrs. Ellmother. Have you noticed
      that she doesn't seem to be in good health?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looks rather pale, Miss Ladd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's more serious than that, Francine. The servants tell me that she has
      hardly any appetite. She herself acknowledges that she sleeps badly. I
      noticed her yesterday evening in the garden, under the schoolroom window.
      One of the girls dropped a dictionary. She started at that slight noise,
      as if it terrified her. Her nerves are seriously out of order. Can you
      prevail upon her to see the doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine hesitated&mdash;and made an excuse. "I think she would be much
      more likely, Miss Ladd, to listen to you. Do you mind speaking to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother was immediately sent for. "What is your pleasure, miss?"
      she said to Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd interposed. "It is I who wish to speak to you, Mrs. Ellmother.
      For some days past, I have been sorry to see you looking ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never was ill in my life, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd gently persisted. "I hear that you have lost your appetite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never was a great eater, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evidently useless to risk any further allusion to Mrs. Ellmother's
      symptoms. Miss Ladd tried another method of persuasion. "I daresay I may
      be mistaken," she said; "but I do really feel anxious about you. To set my
      mind at rest, will you see the doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor! Do you think I'm going to begin taking physic, at my time of
      life? Lord, ma'am! you amuse me&mdash;you do indeed!" She burst into a
      sudden fit of laughter; the hysterical laughter which is on the verge of
      tears. With a desperate effort, she controlled herself. "Please, don't
      make a fool of me again," she said&mdash;and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think now?" Miss Ladd asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine appeared to be still on her guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to think," she said evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd looked at her in silent surprise, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by herself, Francine sat with her elbows on the table and her face in
      her hands, absorbed in thought. After a long interval, she opened her desk&mdash;and
      hesitated. She took a sheet of note-paper&mdash;and paused, as if still in
      doubt. She snatched up her pen, with a sudden recovery of resolution&mdash;and
      addressed these lines to the wife of her father's agent in London:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I was placed under your care, on the night of my arrival from the
      West Indies, you kindly said I might ask you for any little service which
      might be within your power. I shall be greatly obliged if you can obtain
      for me, and send to this place, a supply of artists' modeling wax&mdash;sufficient
      for the product ion of a small image."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. IN THE DARK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later, Alban Morris happened to be in Miss Ladd's study, with a
      report to make on the subject of his drawing-class. Mrs. Ellmother
      interrupted them for a moment. She entered the room to return a book which
      Francine had borrowed that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Miss de Sor done with it already?" Miss Ladd asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She won't read it, ma'am. She says the leaves smell of tobacco-smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd turned to Alban, and shook her head with an air of good-humored
      reproof. "I know who has been reading that book last!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban pleaded guilty, by a look. He was the only master in the school who
      smoked. As Mrs. Ellmother passed him, on her way out, he noticed the signs
      of suffering in her wasted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That woman is surely in a bad state of health," he said. "Has she seen
      the doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She flatly refuses to consult the doctor," Miss Ladd replied. "If she was
      a stranger, I should meet the difficulty by telling Miss de Sor (whose
      servant she is) that Mrs. Ellmother must be sent home. But I cannot act in
      that peremptory manner toward a person in whom Emily is interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Mrs. Ellmother became a person in whom Alban was
      interested. Later in the day, he met her in one of the lower corridors of
      the house, and spoke to her. "I am afraid the air of this place doesn't
      agree with you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother's irritable objection to being told (even indirectly) that
      she looked ill, expressed itself roughly in reply. "I daresay you mean
      well, sir&mdash;but I don't see how it matters to you whether the place
      agrees with me or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute," Alban answered good-humoredly. "I am not quite a stranger
      to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you make that out, if you please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know a young lady who has a sincere regard for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean Miss Emily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do. I respect and admire Miss Emily; and I have tried, in my poor
      way, to be of some little service to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother's haggard face instantly softened. "Please to forgive me,
      sir, for forgetting my manners," she said simply. "I have had my health
      since the day I was born&mdash;and I don't like to be told, in my old age,
      that a new place doesn't agree with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban accepted this apology in a manner which at once won the heart of the
      North-countrywoman. He shook hands with her. "You're one of the right
      sort," she said; "there are not many of them in this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she alluding to Francine? Alban tried to make the discovery. Polite
      circumlocution would be evidently thrown away on Mrs. Ellmother. "Is your
      new mistress one of the right sort?" he asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old servant's answer was expressed by a frowning look, followed by a
      plain question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you say that, sir, because you like my new mistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please to shake hands again!" She said it&mdash;took his hand with a
      sudden grip that spoke for itself&mdash;and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was an exhibition of character which Alban was just the man to
      appreciate. "If I had been an old woman," he thought in his dryly humorous
      way, "I believe I should have been like Mrs. Ellmother. We might have
      talked of Emily, if she had not left me in such a hurry. When shall I see
      her again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was destined to see her again, that night&mdash;under circumstances
      which he remembered to the end of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules of Netherwoods, in summer time, recalled the young ladies from
      their evening's recreation in the grounds at nine o'clock. After that
      hour, Alban was free to smoke his pipe, and to linger among trees and
      flower-beds before he returned to his hot little rooms in the village. As
      a relief to the drudgery of teaching the young ladies, he had been using
      his pencil, when the day's lessons were over, for his own amusement. It
      was past ten o'clock before he lighted his pipe, and began walking slowly
      to and fro on the path which led to the summer-house, at the southern
      limit of the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the perfect stillness of the night, the clock of the village church was
      distinctly audible, striking the hours and the quarters. The moon had not
      risen; but the mysterious glimmer of starlight trembled on the large open
      space between the trees and the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban paused, admiring with an artist's eye the effect of light, so
      faintly and delicately beautiful, on the broad expanse of the lawn. "Does
      the man live who could paint that?" he asked himself. His memory recalled
      the works of the greatest of all landscape painters&mdash;the English
      artists of fifty years since. While recollections of many a noble picture
      were still passing through his mind, he was startled by the sudden
      appearance of a bareheaded woman on the terrace steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried down to the lawn, staggering as she ran&mdash;stopped, and
      looked back at the house&mdash;hastened onward toward the trees&mdash;stopped
      again, looking backward and forward, uncertain which way to turn next&mdash;and
      then advanced once more. He could now hear her heavily gasping for breath.
      As she came nearer, the starlight showed a panic-stricken face&mdash;the
      face of Mrs. Ellmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban ran to meet her. She dropped on the grass before he could cross the
      short distance which separated them. As he raised her in his arms she
      looked at him wildly, and murmured and muttered in the vain attempt to
      speak. "Look at me again," he said. "Don't you remember the man who had
      some talk with you to-day?" She still stared at him vacantly: he tried
      again. "Don't you remember Miss Emily's friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As the name passed his lips, her mind in some degree recovered its
      balance. "Yes," she said; "Emily's friend; I'm glad I have met with
      Emily's friend." She caught at Alban's arm&mdash;starting as if her own
      words had alarmed her. "What am I talking about? Did I say 'Emily'? A
      servant ought to say 'Miss Emily.' My head swims. Am I going mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban led her to one of the garden chairs. "You're only a little
      frightened," he said. "Rest, and compose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked over her shoulder toward the house. "Not here! I've run away
      from a she-devil; I want to be out of sight. Further away, Mister&mdash;I
      don't know your name. Tell me your name; I won't trust you, unless you
      tell me your name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hush! Call me Alban."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard of such a name; I won't trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't trust your friend, and Emily's friend? You don't mean that, I'm
      sure. Call me by my other name&mdash;call me 'Morris.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morris?" she repeated. "Ah, I've heard of people called 'Morris.' Look
      back! Your eyes are young&mdash;do you see her on the terrace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There isn't a living soul to be seen anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      With one hand he raised her as he spoke&mdash;and with the other he took
      up the chair. In a minute more, they were out of sight of the house. He
      seated her so that she could rest her head against the trunk of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a good fellow!" the poor old creature said, admiring him; "he knows
      how my head pains me. Don't stand up! You're a tall man. She might see
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can see nothing. Look at the trees behind us. Even the starlight
      doesn't get through them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother was not satisfied yet. "You take it coolly," she said. "Do
      you know who saw us together in the passage to-day? You good Morris, <i>she</i>
      saw us&mdash;she did. Wretch! Cruel, cunning, shameless wretch."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the shadows that were round them, Alban could just see that she was
      shaking her clinched fists in the air. He made another attempt to control
      her. "Don't excite yourself! If she comes into the garden, she might hear
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal to her fears had its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," she said, in lowered tones. A sudden distrust of him seized
      her the next moment. "Who told me I was excited?" she burst out. "It's you
      who are excited. Deny it if you dare; I begin to suspect you, Mr. Morris;
      I don't like your conduct. What has become of your pipe? I saw you put
      your pipe in your coat pocket. You did it when you set me down among the
      trees where <i>she</i> could see me! You are in league with her&mdash;she
      is coming to meet you here&mdash;you know she does not like tobacco-smoke.
      Are you two going to put me in the madhouse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She started to her feet. It occurred to Alban that the speediest way of
      pacifying her might be by means of the pipe. Mere words would exercise no
      persuasive influence over that bewildered mind. Instant action, of some
      kind, would be far more likely to have the right effect. He put his pipe
      and his tobacco pouch into her hands, and so mastered her attention before
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know how to fill a man's pipe for him?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I filled my husband's pipe hundreds of times?" she answered
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Now do it for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her chair again instantly, and filled the pipe. He lighted it,
      and seated himself on the grass, quietly smoking. "Do you think I'm in
      league with her now?" he asked, purposely adopting the rough tone of a man
      in her own rank of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him as she might have answered her husband, in the days of
      her unhappy marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't gird at me, there's a good man! If I've been off my head for a
      minute or two, please not to notice me. It's cool and quiet here," the
      poor woman said gratefully. "Bless God for the darkness; there's something
      comforting in the darkness&mdash;along with a good man like you. Give me a
      word of advice. You are my friend in need. What am I to do? I daren't go
      back to the house!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quiet enough now, to suggest the hope that she might be able to
      give Alban some information "Were you with Miss de Sor," he asked, "before
      you came out here? What did she do to frighten you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer; Mrs. Ellmother had abruptly risen once more. "Hush!"
      she whispered. "Don't I hear somebody near us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban at once went back, along the winding path which they had followed.
      No creature was visible in the gardens or on the terrace. On returning, he
      found it impossible to use his eyes to any good purpose in the obscurity
      among the trees. He waited a while, listening intently. No sound was
      audible: there was not even air enough to stir the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he returned to the place that he had left, the silence was broken by
      the chimes of the distant church clock, striking the three-quarters past
      ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even that familiar sound jarred on Mrs. Ellmother's shattered nerves. In
      her state of mind and body, she was evidently at the mercy of any false
      alarm which might be raised by her own fears. Relieved of the feeling of
      distrust which had thus far troubled him, Alban sat down by her again&mdash;opened
      his match-box to relight his pipe&mdash;and changed his mind. Mrs.
      Ellmother had unconsciously warned him to be cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, he thought it likely that the heat in the house might
      induce some of the inmates to try the cooler atmosphere in the grounds. If
      this happened, and if he continued to smoke, curiosity might tempt them to
      follow the scent of tobacco hanging on the stagnant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there nobody near us?" Mrs. Ellmother asked. "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure. Now tell me, did you really mean it, when you said just now
      that you wanted my advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Need you ask that, sir? Who else have I got to help me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ready and willing to help you&mdash;but I can't do it unless I know
      first what has passed between you and Miss de Sor. Will you trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I depend on you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try me!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE TREACHERY OF THE PIPE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alban took Mrs. Ellmother at her word. "I am going to venture on a guess,"
      he said. "You have been with Miss de Sor to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true, Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to guess again. Did Miss de Sor ask you to stay with her, when
      you went into her room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it! She rang for me, to see how I was getting on with my
      needlework&mdash;and she was what I call hearty, for the first time since
      I have been in her service. I didn't think badly of her when she first
      talked of engaging me; and I've had reason to repent of my opinion ever
      since. Oh, she showed the cloven foot to-night! 'Sit down,' she says;
      'I've nothing to read, and I hate work; let's have a little chat.' She's
      got a glib tongue of her own. All I could do was to say a word now and
      then to keep her going. She talked and talked till it was time to light
      the lamp. She was particular in telling me to put the shade over it. We
      were half in the dark, and half in the light. She trapped me (Lord knows
      how!) into talking about foreign parts; I mean the place she lived in
      before they sent her to England. Have you heard that she comes from the
      West Indies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I have heard that. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a bit, sir. There's something, by your leave, that I want to know.
      Do you believe in Witchcraft?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about it. Did Miss de Sor put that question to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how did you answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither in one way nor the other. I'm in two minds about that matter of
      Witchcraft. When I was a girl, there was an old woman in our village, who
      was a sort of show. People came to see her from all the country round&mdash;gentlefolks
      among them. It was her great age that made her famous. More than a hundred
      years old, sir! One of our neighbors didn't believe in her age, and she
      heard of it. She cast a spell on his flock. I tell you, she sent a plague
      on his sheep, the plague of the Bots. The whole flock died; I remember it
      well. Some said the sheep would have had the Bots anyhow. Some said it was
      the spell. Which of them was right? How am I to settle it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you mention this to Miss de Sor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was obliged to mention it. Didn't I tell you, just now, that I can't
      make up my mind about Witchcraft? 'You don't seem to know whether you
      believe or disbelieve,' she says. It made me look like a fool. I told her
      I had my reasons, and then I was obliged to give them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did she do then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said, 'I've got a better story of Witchcraft than yours.' And she
      opened a little book, with a lot of writing in it, and began to read. Her
      story made my flesh creep. It turns me cold, sir, when I think of it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her moaning and shuddering. Strongly as his interest was excited,
      there was a compassionate reluctance in him to ask her to go on. His
      merciful scruples proved to be needless. The fascination of beauty it is
      possible to resist. The fascination of horror fastens its fearful hold on
      us, struggle against it as we may. Mrs. Ellmother repeated what she had
      heard, in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happened in the West Indies," she said; "and the writing of a woman
      slave was the writing in the little book. The slave wrote about her
      mother. Her mother was a black&mdash;a Witch in her own country. There was
      a forest in her own country. The devil taught her Witchcraft in the
      forest. The serpents and the wild beasts were afraid to touch her. She
      lived without eating. She was sold for a slave, and sent to the island&mdash;an
      island in the West Indies. An old man lived there; the wickedest man of
      them all. He filled the black Witch with devilish knowledge. She learned
      to make the image of wax. The image of wax casts spells. You put pins in
      the image of wax. At every pin you put, the person under the spell gets
      nearer and nearer to death. There was a poor black in the island. He
      offended the Witch. She made his image in wax; she cast spells on him. He
      couldn't sleep; he couldn't eat; he was such a coward that common noises
      frightened him. Like Me! Oh, God, like me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a little," Alban interposed. "You are exciting yourself again&mdash;wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're wrong, sir! You think it ended when she finished her story, and
      shut up her book; there's worse to come than anything you've heard yet. I
      don't know what I did to offend her. She looked at me and spoke to me, as
      if I was the dirt under her feet. 'If you're too stupid to understand what
      I have been reading,' she says, 'get up and go to the glass. Look at
      yourself, and remember what happened to the slave who was under the spell.
      You're getting paler and paler, and thinner and thinner; you're pining
      away just as he did. Shall I tell you why?' She snatched off the shade
      from the lamp, and put her hand under the table, and brought out an image
      of wax. <i>My</i> image! She pointed to three pins in it. 'One,' she says,
      'for no sleep. One for no appetite. One for broken nerves.' I asked her
      what I had done to make such a bitter enemy of her. She says, 'Remember
      what I asked of you when we talked of your being my servant. Choose which
      you will do? Die by inches' (I swear she said it as I hope to be saved);
      'die by inches, or tell me&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      There&mdash;in the full frenzy of the agitation that possessed her&mdash;there,
      Mrs. Ellmother suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's first impression was that she might have fainted. He looked
      closer, and could just see her shadowy figure still seated in the chair.
      He asked if she was ill. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why don't you go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you can put me off," he rejoined sternly, "with such an
      excuse as that? What did Miss de Sor ask you to tell her? You promised to
      trust me. Be as good as your word."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of her health and strength, she would have set him at
      defiance. All she could do now was to appeal to his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make some allowance for me," she said. "I have been terribly upset. What
      has become of my courage? What has broken me down in this way? Spare me,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused to listen. "This vile attempt to practice on your fears may be
      repeated," he reminded her. "More cruel advantage may be taken of the
      nervous derangement from which you are suffering in the climate of this
      place. You little know me, if you think I will allow that to go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a last effort to plead with him. "Oh sir, is this behaving like
      the good kind man I thought you were? You say you are Miss Emily's friend?
      Don't press me&mdash;for Miss Emily's sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily!" Alban exclaimed. "Is <i>she</i> concerned in this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a change to tenderness in his voice, which persuaded Mrs.
      Ellmother that she had found her way to the weak side of him. Her one
      effort now was to strengthen the impression which she believed herself to
      have produced. "Miss Emily <i>is</i> concerned in it," she confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind in what way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, sir, Miss Emily must never know it to her dying day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The first suspicion of the truth crossed Alban's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you at last," he said. "What Miss Emily must never know&mdash;is
      what Miss de Sor wanted you to tell her. Oh, it's useless to contradict
      me! Her motive in trying to frighten you is as plain to me now as if she
      had confessed it. Are you sure you didn't betray yourself, when she showed
      the image of wax?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have died first!" The reply had hardly escaped her before she
      regretted it. "What makes you want to be so sure about it?" she said. "It
      looks as if you knew&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindest thing that he could do now was to speak out. "Your secret is
      no secret to <i>me</i>," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rage and fear shook her together. For the moment she was like the Mrs.
      Ellmother of former days. "You lie!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I speak the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't believe you! I daren't believe you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me. In Emily's interests, listen to me. I have read of the
      murder at Zeeland&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's nothing! The man was a namesake of her father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man was her father himself. Keep your seat! There is nothing to be
      alarmed about. I know that Emily is ignorant of the horrid death that her
      father died. I know that you and your late mistress have kept the
      discovery from her to this day. I know the love and pity which plead your
      excuse for deceiving her, and the circumstances that favored the
      deception. My good creature, Emily's peace of mind is as sacred to me as
      it is to you! I love her as I love my own life&mdash;and better. Are you
      calmer, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her crying: it was the best relief that could come to her. After
      waiting a while to let the tears have their way, he helped her to rise.
      There was no more to be said now. The one thing to do was to take her back
      to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can give you a word of advice," he said, "before we part for the night.
      You must leave Miss de Sor's service at once. Your health will be a
      sufficient excuse. Give her warning immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother hung back, when he offered her his arm. The bare prospect
      of seeing Francine again was revolting to her. On Alban's assurance that
      the notice to leave could be given in writing, she made no further
      resistance. The village clock struck eleven as they ascended the terrace
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later, another person left the grounds by the path which led to
      the house. Alban's precaution had been taken too late. The smell of
      tobacco-smoke had guided Francine, when she was at a loss which way to
      turn next in search of Mrs. Ellmother. For the last quarter of an hour she
      had been listening, hidden among the trees.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. CHANGE OF AIR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The inmates of Netherwoods rose early, and went to bed early. When Alban
      and Mrs. Ellmother arrived at the back door of the house, they found it
      locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only light visible, along the whole length of the building, glimmered
      through the Venetian blind of the window-entrance to Francine's
      sitting-room. Alban proposed to get admission to the house by that way. In
      her horror of again encountering Francine, Mrs. Ellmother positively
      refused to follow him when he turned away from the door. "They can't be
      all asleep yet," she said&mdash;and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      One person was still out of bed&mdash;and that person was the mistress of
      the house. They recognized her voice in the customary question: "Who's
      there?" The door having been opened, good Miss Ladd looked backward and
      forward between Alban and Mrs. Ellmother, with the bewildered air of a
      lady who doubted the evidence of her own eyes. The next moment, her sense
      of humor overpowered her. She burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close the door, Mr. Morris," she said, "and be so good as to tell me what
      this means. Have you been giving a lesson in drawing by starlight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother moved, so that the light of the lamp in Miss Ladd's hand
      fell on her face. "I am faint and giddy," she said; "let me go to my bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd instantly followed her. "Pray forgive me! I didn't see you were
      ill, when I spoke," she gently explained. "What can I do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you kindly, ma'am. I want nothing but peace and quiet. I wish you
      good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban followed Miss Ladd to her study, on the front side of the house. He
      had just mentioned the circumstances under which he and Mrs. Ellmother had
      met, when they were interrupted by a tap at the door. Francine had got
      back to her room unperceived, by way of the French window. She now
      presented herself, with an elaborate apology, and with the nearest
      approach to a penitent expression of which her face was capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ashamed, Miss Ladd, to intrude on you at this time of night. My only
      excuse is, that I am anxious about Mrs. Ellmother. I heard you just now in
      the hall. If she is really ill, I am the unfortunate cause of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way, Miss de Sor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to say I frightened her&mdash;while we were talking in my room&mdash;quite
      unintentionally. She rushed to the door and ran out. I supposed she had
      gone to her bedroom; I had no idea she was in the grounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this false statement there was mingled a grain of truth. It was true
      that Francine believed Mrs. Ellmother to have taken refuge in her room&mdash;for
      she had examined the room. Finding it empty, and failing to discover the
      fugitive in other parts of the house, she had become alarmed, and had
      tried the grounds next&mdash;with the formidable result which has been
      already related. Concealing this circumstance, she had lied in such a
      skillfully artless manner that Alban (having no suspicion of what had
      really happened to sharpen his wits) was as completely deceived as Miss
      Ladd. Proceeding to further explanation&mdash;and remembering that she was
      in Alban's presence&mdash;Francine was careful to keep herself within the
      strict limit of truth. Confessing that she had frightened her servant by a
      description of sorcery, as it was practiced among the slaves on her
      father's estate, she only lied again, in declaring that Mrs. Ellmother had
      supposed she was in earnest, when she was guilty of no more serious
      offense than playing a practical joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, Alban was necessarily in a position to detect the falsehood.
      But it was so evidently in Francine's interests to present her conduct in
      the most favorable light, that the discovery failed to excite his
      suspicion. He waited in silence, while Miss Ladd administered a severe
      reproof. Francine having left the room, as penitently as she had entered
      it (with her handkerchief over her tearless eyes), he was at liberty, with
      certain reserves, to return to what had passed between Mrs. Ellmother and
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fright which the poor old woman has suffered," he said, "has led to
      one good result. I have found her ready at last to acknowledge that she is
      ill, and inclined to believe that the change to Netherwoods has had
      something to do with it. I have advised her to take the course which you
      suggested, by leaving this house. Is it possible to dispense with the
      usual delay, when she gives notice to leave Miss de Sor's service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She need feel no anxiety, poor soul, on that account," Miss Ladd replied.
      "In any case, I had arranged that a week's notice on either side should be
      enough. As it is, I will speak to Francine myself. The least she can do,
      to express her regret, is to place no difficulties in Mrs. Ellmother's
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd broke through her rule of attending to secular affairs on week
      days only; and, after consulting with Mrs. Ellmother, arranged with
      Francine that her servant should be at liberty to leave Netherwoods
      (health permitting) on the next day. But one difficulty remained. Mrs.
      Ellmother was in no condition to take the long journey to her birthplace
      in Cumberland; and her own lodgings in London had been let.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances, what was the best arrangement that could be
      made for her? Miss Ladd wisely and kindly wrote to Emily on the subject,
      and asked for a speedy reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day, Alban was sent for to see Mrs. Ellmother. He found her
      anxiously waiting to hear what had passed, on the previous night, between
      Miss Ladd and himself. "Were you careful, sir, to say nothing about Miss
      Emily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was especially careful; I never alluded to her in any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Miss de Sor spoken to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not given her the opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's an obstinate one&mdash;she might try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she does, she shall hear my opinion of her in plain words." The talk
      between them turned next on Alban's discovery of the secret, of which Mrs.
      Ellmother had believed herself to be the sole depositary since Miss
      Letitia's death. Without alarming her by any needless allusion to Doctor
      Allday or to Miss Jethro, he answered her inquiries (so far as he was
      himself concerned) without reserve. Her curiosity once satisfied, she
      showed no disposition to pursue the topic. She pointed to Miss Ladd's cat,
      fast asleep by the side of an empty saucer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a sin, Mr. Morris, to wish I was Tom? <i>He</i> doesn't trouble
      himself about his life that is past or his life that is to come. If I
      could only empty my saucer and go to sleep, I shouldn't be thinking of the
      number of people in this world, like myself, who would be better out of it
      than in it. Miss Ladd has got me my liberty tomorrow; and I don't even
      know where to go, when I leave this place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you follow Tom's example?" Alban suggested. "Enjoy to-day (in
      that comfortable chair) and let to-morrow take care of itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow arrived, and justified Alban's system of philosophy. Emily
      answered Miss Ladd's letter, to excellent purpose, by telegraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave London to-day with Cecilia" (the message announced) "for
      Monksmoor Park, Hants. Will Mrs. Ellmother take care of the cottage in my
      absence? I shall be away for a month, at least. All is prepared for her if
      she consents."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother gladly accepted this proposal. In the interval of Emily's
      absence, she could easily arrange to return to her own lodgings. With
      words of sincere gratitude she took leave of Miss Ladd; but no persuasion
      would induce her to say good-by to Francine. "Do me one more kindness,
      ma'am; don't tell Miss de Sor when I go away." Ignorant of the provocation
      which had produced this unforgiving temper of mind, Miss Ladd gently
      remonstrated. "Miss de Sor received my reproof in a penitent spirit; she
      expresses sincere sorrow for having thoughtlessly frightened you. Both
      yesterday and to-day she has made kind inquiries after your health. Come!
      come! don't bear malice&mdash;wish her good-by." Mrs. Ellmother's answer
      was characteristic. "I'll say good-by by telegraph, when I get to London."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her last words were addressed to Alban. "If you can find a way of doing
      it, sir, keep those two apart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean Emily and Miss de Sor?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you afraid of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that quite reasonable, Mrs. Ellmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay not. I only know that I <i>am</i> afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pony chaise took her away. Alban's class was not yet ready for him. He
      waited on the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Innocent alike of all knowledge of the serious reason for fear which did
      really exist, Mrs. Ellmother and Alban felt, nevertheless, the same vague
      distrust of an intimacy between the two girls. Idle, vain, malicious,
      false&mdash;to know that Francine's character presented these faults,
      without any discoverable merits to set against them, was surely enough to
      justify a gloomy view of the prospect, if she succeeded in winning the
      position of Emily's friend. Alban reasoned it out logically in this way&mdash;without
      satisfying himself, and without accounting for the remembrance that
      haunted him of Mrs. Ellmother's farewell look. "A commonplace man would
      say we are both in a morbid state of mind," he thought; "and sometimes
      commonplace men turn out to be right."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too deeply preoccupied to notice that he had advanced perilously
      near Francine's window. She suddenly stepped out of her room, and spoke to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you happen to know, Mr. Morris, why Mrs. Ellmother has gone away
      without bidding me good-by?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was probably afraid, Miss de Sor, that you might make her the victim
      of another joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine eyed him steadily. "Have you any particular reason for speaking
      to me in that way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not aware that I have answered you rudely&mdash;if that is what you
      mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is <i>not</i> what I mean. You seem to have taken a dislike to me. I
      should be glad to know why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dislike cruelty&mdash;and you have behaved cruelly to Mrs. Ellmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meaning to be cruel?" Francine inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know as well as I do, Miss de Sor, that I can't answer that
      question."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine looked at him again "Am I to understand that we are enemies?" she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to understand," he replied, "that a person whom Miss Ladd employs
      to help her in teaching, cannot always presume to express his sentiments
      in speaking to the young ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that means anything, Mr. Morris, it means that we are enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means, Miss de Sor, that I am the drawing-master at this school, and
      that I am called to my class."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine returned to her room, relieved of the only doubt that had
      troubled her. Plainly no suspicion that she had overheard what passed
      between Mrs. Ellmother and himself existed in Alban's mind. As to the use
      to be made of her discovery, she felt no difficulty in deciding to wait,
      and be guided by events. Her curiosity and her self-esteem had been alike
      gratified&mdash;she had got the better of Mrs. Ellmother at last, and with
      that triumph she was content. While Emily remained her friend, it would be
      an act of useless cruelty to disclose the terrible truth. There had
      certainly been a coolness between them at Brighton. But Francine&mdash;still
      influenced by the magnetic attraction which drew her to Emily&mdash;did
      not conceal from herself that she had offered the provocation, and had
      been therefore the person to blame. "I can set all that right," she
      thought, "when we meet at Monksmoor Park." She opened her desk and wrote
      the shortest and sweetest of letters to Cecilia. "I am entirely at the
      disposal of my charming friend, on any convenient day&mdash;may I add, my
      dear, the sooner the better?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. "THE LADY WANTS YOU, SIR."
    </h2>
    <p>
      The pupils of the drawing-class put away their pencils and color-boxes in
      high good humor: the teacher's vigilant eye for faults had failed him for
      the first time in their experience. Not one of them had been reproved;
      they had chattered and giggled and drawn caricatures on the margin of the
      paper, as freely as if the master had left the room. Alban's wandering
      attention was indeed beyond the reach of control. His interview with
      Francine had doubled his sense of responsibility toward Emily&mdash;while
      he was further than ever from seeing how he could interfere, to any useful
      purpose, in his present position, and with his reasons for writing under
      reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the servants addressed him as he was leaving the schoolroom. The
      landlady's boy was waiting in the hall, with a message from his lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then! what is it?" he asked, irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lady wants you, sir." With this mysterious answer, the boy presented
      a visiting card. The name inscribed on it was&mdash;"Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had arrived by the train, and she was then waiting at Alban's
      lodgings. "Say I will be with her directly." Having given the message, he
      stood for a while, with his hat in his hand&mdash;literally lost in
      astonishment. It was simply impossible to guess at Miss Jethro's object:
      and yet, with the usual perversity of human nature, he was still wondering
      what she could possibly want with him, up to the final moment when he
      opened the door of his sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and bowed with the same grace of movement, and the same well-bred
      composure of manner, which Doctor Allday had noticed when she entered his
      consulting-room. Her dark melancholy eyes rested on Alban with a look of
      gentle interest. A faint flush of color animated for a moment the faded
      beauty of her face&mdash;passed away again&mdash;and left it paler than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot conceal from myself," she began, "that I am intruding on you
      under embarrassing circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask, Miss Jethro, to what circumstances you allude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget, Mr. Morris, that I left Miss Ladd's school, in a manner which
      justified doubt of me in the minds of strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speaking as one of those strangers," Alban replied, "I cannot feel that I
      had any right to form an opinion, on a matter which only concerned Miss
      Ladd and yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro bowed gravely. "You encourage me to hope," she said. "I think
      you will place a favorable construction on my visit when I mention my
      motive. I ask you to receive me, in the interests of Miss Emily Brown."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stating her purpose in calling on him in those plain terms, she added to
      the amazement which Alban already felt, by handing to him&mdash;as if she
      was presenting an introduction&mdash;a letter marked, "Private," addressed
      to her by Doctor Allday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may tell you," she premised, "that I had no idea of troubling you,
      until Doctor Allday suggested it. I wrote to him in the first instance;
      and there is his reply. Pray read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was dated, "Penzance"; and the doctor wrote, as he spoke,
      without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MADAM&mdash;Your letter has been forwarded to me. I am spending my autumn
      holiday in the far West of Cornwall. However, if I had been at home, it
      would have made no difference. I should have begged leave to decline
      holding any further conversation with you, on the subject of Miss Emily
      Brown, for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, though I cannot doubt your sincere interest in the
      young lady's welfare, I don't like your mysterious way of showing it. In
      the second place, when I called at your address in London, after you had
      left my house, I found that you had taken to flight. I place my own
      interpretation on this circumstance; but as it is not founded on any
      knowledge of facts, I merely allude to it, and say no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at that point, Alban offered to return the letter. "Do you really
      mean me to go on reading it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban returned to the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the third place, I have good reason to believe that you entered Miss
      Ladd's school as a teacher, under false pretenses. After that discovery, I
      tell you plainly I hesitate to attach credit to any statement that you may
      wish to make. At the same time, I must not permit my prejudices (as you
      will probably call them) to stand in the way of Miss Emily's interests&mdash;supposing
      them to be really depending on any interference of yours. Miss Ladd's
      drawing-master, Mr. Alban Morris, is even more devoted to Miss Emily's
      service than I am. Whatever you might have said to me, you can say to him&mdash;with
      this possible advantage, that <i>he</i> may believe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There the letter ended. Alban handed it back in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro pointed to the words, "Mr. Alban Morris is even more devoted
      to Miss Emily's service than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that true?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't complain, Mr. Morris, of the hard things said of me in that
      letter; you are at liberty to suppose, if you like, that I deserve them.
      Attribute it to pride, or attribute it to reluctance to make needless
      demands on your time&mdash;I shall not attempt to defend myself. I leave
      you to decide whether the woman who has shown you that letter&mdash;having
      something important to say to you&mdash;is a person who is mean enough to
      say it under false pretenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what I can do for you, Miss Jethro: and be assured, beforehand,
      that I don't doubt your sincerity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My purpose in coming here," she answered, "is to induce you to use your
      influence over Miss Emily Brown&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With what object?" Alban asked, interrupting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My object is her own good. Some years since, I happened to become
      acquainted with a person who has attained some celebrity as a preacher.
      You have perhaps heard of Mr. Miles Mirabel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been in correspondence with him," Miss Jethro proceeded. "He tells
      me he has been introduced to a young lady, who was formerly one of Miss
      Ladd's pupils, and who is the daughter of Mr. Wyvil, of Monksmoor Park. He
      has called on Mr. Wyvil; and he has since received an invitation to stay
      at Mr. Wyvil's house. The day fixed for the visit is Monday, the fifth of
      next month."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban listened&mdash;at a loss to know what interest he was supposed to
      have in being made acquainted with Mr. Mirabel's engagements. Miss
      Jethro's next words enlightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are perhaps aware," she resumed, "that Miss Emily Brown is Miss
      Wyvil's intimate friend. She will be one of the guests at Monksmoor Park.
      If there are any obstacles which you can place in her way&mdash;if there
      is any influence which you can exert, without exciting suspicion of your
      motive&mdash;prevent her, I entreat you, from accepting Miss Wyvil's
      invitation, until Mr. Mirabel's visit has come to an end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything against Mr. Mirabel?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say nothing against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Miss Emily acquainted with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he a person with whom it would be disagreeable to her to associate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite the contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you expect me to prevent them from meeting! Be reasonable, Miss
      Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only be in earnest, Mr. Morris&mdash;more truly, more deeply in
      earnest than you can suppose. I declare to you that I am speaking in Miss
      Emily's interests. Do you still refuse to exert yourself for her sake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am spared the pain of refusal," Alban answered. "The time for
      interference has gone by. She is, at this moment, on her way to Monksmoor
      Park."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jethro attempted to rise&mdash;and dropped back into her chair.
      "Water!" she said faintly. After drinking from the glass to the last drop,
      she began to revive. Her little traveling-bag was on the floor at her
      side. She took out a railway guide, and tried to consult it. Her fingers
      trembled incessantly; she was unable to find the page to which she wished
      to refer. "Help me," she said, "I must leave this place&mdash;by the first
      train that passes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see Emily?" Alban asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite useless! You have said it yourself&mdash;the time for interference
      has gone by. Look at the guide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What place shall I look for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look for Vale Regis."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban found the place. The train was due in ten minutes. "Surely you are
      not fit to travel so soon?" he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fit or not, I must see Mr. Mirabel&mdash;I must make the effort to keep
      them apart by appealing to <i>him</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With any hope of success?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With no hope&mdash;and with no interest in the man himself. Still I must
      try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of anxiety for Emily's welfare?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of anxiety for more than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can't guess, I daren't tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      That strange reply startled Alban. Before he could ask what it meant, Miss
      Jethro had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the emergencies of life, a person readier of resource than Alban Morris
      it would not have been easy to discover. The extraordinary interview that
      had now come to an end had found its limits. Bewildered and helpless, he
      stood at the window of his room, and asked himself (as if he had been the
      weakest man living), "What shall I do?"

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. DANCING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The windows of the long drawing-room at Monksmoor are all thrown open to
      the conservatory. Distant masses of plants and flowers, mingled in
      ever-varying forms of beauty, are touched by the melancholy luster of the
      rising moon. Nearer to the house, the restful shadows are disturbed at
      intervals, where streams of light fall over them aslant from the lamps in
      the room. The fountain is playing. In rivalry with its lighter music, the
      nightingales are singing their song of ecstasy. Sometimes, the laughter of
      girls is heard&mdash;and, sometimes, the melody of a waltz. The younger
      guests at Monksmoor are dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily and Cecilia are dressed alike in white, with flowers in their hair.
      Francine rivals them by means of a gorgeous contrast of color, and
      declares that she is rich with the bright emphasis of diamonds and the
      soft persuasion of pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Plym (from the rectory) is fat and fair and prosperous: she overflows
      with good spirits; she has a waist which defies tight-lacing, and she
      dances joyously on large flat feet. Miss Darnaway (officer's daughter with
      small means) is the exact opposite of Miss Plym. She is thin and tall and
      faded&mdash;poor soul. Destiny has made it her hard lot in life to fill
      the place of head-nursemaid at home. In her pensive moments, she thinks of
      the little brothers and sisters, whose patient servant she is, and wonders
      who comforts them in their tumbles and tells them stories at bedtime,
      while she is holiday-making at the pleasant country house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tender-hearted Cecilia, remembering how few pleasures this young friend
      has, and knowing how well she dances, never allows her to be without a
      partner. There are three invaluable young gentlemen present, who are
      excellent dancers. Members of different families, they are nevertheless
      fearfully and wonderfully like each other. They present the same rosy
      complexions and straw-colored mustachios, the same plump cheeks, vacant
      eyes and low forehead; and they utter, with the same stolid gravity, the
      same imbecile small talk. On sofas facing each other sit the two remaining
      guests, who have not joined the elders at the card-table in another room.
      They are both men. One of them is drowsy and middle-aged&mdash;happy in
      the possession of large landed property: happier still in a capacity for
      drinking Mr. Wyvil's famous port-wine without gouty results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other gentleman&mdash;ah, who is the other? He is the confidential
      adviser and bosom friend of every young lady in the house. Is it necessary
      to name the Reverend Miles Mirabel?
    </p>
    <p>
      There he sits enthroned, with room for a fair admirer on either side of
      him&mdash;the clerical sultan of a platonic harem. His persuasive ministry
      is felt as well as heard: he has an innocent habit of fondling young
      persons. One of his arms is even long enough to embrace the circumference
      of Miss Plym&mdash;while the other clasps the rigid silken waist of
      Francine. "I do it everywhere else," he says innocently, "why not here?"
      Why not indeed&mdash;with that delicate complexion and those beautiful
      blue eyes; with the glorious golden hair that rests on his shoulders, and
      the glossy beard that flows over his breast? Familiarities, forbidden to
      mere men, become privileges and condescensions when an angel enters
      society&mdash;and more especially when that angel has enough of mortality
      in him to be amusing. Mr. Mirabel, on his social side, is an irresistible
      companion. He is cheerfulness itself; he takes a favorable view of
      everything; his sweet temper never differs with anybody. "In my humble
      way," he confesses, "I like to make the world about me brighter." Laughter
      (harmlessly produced, observe!) is the element in which he lives and
      breathes. Miss Darnaway's serious face puts him out; he has laid a bet
      with Emily&mdash;not in money, not even in gloves, only in flowers&mdash;that
      he will make Miss Darnaway laugh; and he has won the wager. Emily's
      flowers are in his button-hole, peeping through the curly interstices of
      his beard. "Must you leave me?" he asks tenderly, when there is a dancing
      man at liberty, and it is Francine's turn to claim him. She leaves her
      seat not very willingly. For a while, the place is vacant; Miss Plym
      seizes the opportunity of consulting the ladies' bosom friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mr. Mirabel, do tell me what you think of Miss de Sor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Mirabel bursts into enthusiasm and makes a charming reply. His
      large experience of young ladies warns him that they will tell each other
      what he thinks of them, when they retire for the night; and he is careful
      on these occasions to say something that will bear repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see in Miss de Sor," he declares, "the resolution of a man, tempered by
      the sweetness of a woman. When that interesting creature marries, her
      husband will be&mdash;shall I use the vulgar word?&mdash;henpecked. Dear
      Miss Plym, he will enjoy it; and he will be quite right too; and, if I am
      asked to the wedding, I shall say, with heartfelt sincerity, Enviable
      man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the height of her admiration for Mr. Mirabel's wonderful eye for
      character, Miss Plym is called away to the piano. Cecilia succeeds to her
      friend's place&mdash;and has her waist taken in charge as a matter of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you like Miss Plym?" she asks directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mirabel smiles, and shows the prettiest little pearly teeth. "I was
      just thinking of her," he confesses pleasantly; "Miss Plym is so nice and
      plump, so comforting and domestic&mdash;such a perfect clergyman's
      daughter. You love her, don't you? Is she engaged to be married? In that
      case&mdash;between ourselves, dear Miss Wyvil, a clergyman is obliged to
      be cautious&mdash;I may own that I love her too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Delicious titillations of flattered self-esteem betray themselves in
      Cecilia's lovely complexion. She is the chosen confidante of this
      irresistible man; and she would like to express her sense of obligation.
      But Mr. Mirabel is a master in the art of putting the right words in the
      right places; and simple Cecilia distrusts herself and her grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment of embarrassment, a friend leaves the dance, and helps
      Cecilia out of the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily approaches the sofa-throne, breathless&mdash;followed by her
      partner, entreating her to give him "one turn more." She is not to be
      tempted; she means to rest. Cecilia sees an act of mercy, suggested by the
      presence of the disengaged young man. She seizes his arm, and hurries him
      off to poor Miss Darnaway; sitting forlorn in a corner, and thinking of
      the nursery at home. In the meanwhile a circumstance occurs. Mr. Mirabel's
      all-embracing arm shows itself in a new character, when Emily sits by his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It becomes, for the first time, an irresolute arm. It advances a little&mdash;and
      hesitates. Emily at once administers an unexpected check; she insists on
      preserving a free waist, in her own outspoken language. "No, Mr. Mirabel,
      keep that for the others. You can't imagine how ridiculous you and the
      young ladies look, and how absurdly unaware of it you all seem to be." For
      the first time in his life, the reverend and ready-witted man of the world
      is at a loss for an answer. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      For this simple reason. He too has felt the magnetic attraction of the
      irresistible little creature whom every one likes. Miss Jethro has been
      doubly defeated. She has failed to keep them apart; and her unexplained
      misgivings have not been justified by events: Emily and Mr. Mirabel are
      good friends already. The brilliant clergyman is poor; his interests in
      life point to a marriage for money; he has fascinated the heiresses of two
      rich fathers, Mr. Tyvil and Mr. de Sor&mdash;and yet he is conscious of an
      influence (an alien influence, without a balance at its bankers), which
      has, in some mysterious way, got between him and his interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Emily's side, the attraction felt is of another nature altogether.
      Among the merry young people at Monksmoor she is her old happy self again;
      and she finds in Mr. Mirabel the most agreeable and amusing man whom she
      has ever met. After those dismal night watches by the bed of her dying
      aunt, and the dreary weeks of solitude that followed, to live in this new
      world of luxury and gayety is like escaping from the darkness of night,
      and basking in the fall brightn ess of day. Cecilia declares that she
      looks, once more, like the joyous queen of the bedroom, in the bygone time
      at school; and Francine (profaning Shakespeare without knowing it), says,
      "Emily is herself again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that your arm is in its right place, reverend sir," she gayly
      resumes, "I may admit that there are exceptions to all rules. My waist is
      at your disposal, in a case of necessity&mdash;that is to say, in a case
      of waltzing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one case of all others," Mirabel answers, with the engaging frankness
      that has won him so many friends, "which can never happen in my unhappy
      experience. Waltzing, I blush to own it, means picking me up off the
      floor, and putting smelling salts to my nostrils. In other words, dear
      Miss Emily, it is the room that waltzes&mdash;not I. I can't look at those
      whirling couples there, with a steady head. Even the exquisite figure of
      our young hostess, when it describes flying circles, turns me giddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing this allusion to Cecilia, Emily drops to the level of the other
      girls. She too pays her homage to the Pope of private life. "You promised
      me your unbiased opinion of Cecilia," she reminds him; "and you haven't
      given it yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies' friend gently remonstrates. "Miss Wyvil's beauty dazzles me.
      How can I give an unbiased opinion? Besides, I am not thinking of her; I
      can only think of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily lifts her eyes, half merrily, half tenderly, and looks at him over
      the top of her fan. It is her first effort at flirtation. She is tempted
      to engage in the most interesting of all games to a girl&mdash;the game
      which plays at making love. What has Cecilia told her, in those bedroom
      gossipings, dear to the hearts of the two friends? Cecilia has whispered,
      "Mr. Mirabel admires your figure; he calls you 'the Venus of Milo, in a
      state of perfect abridgment.'" Where is the daughter of Eve, who would not
      have been flattered by that pretty compliment&mdash;who would not have
      talked soft nonsense in return? "You can only think of Me," Emily repeats
      coquettishly. "Have you said that to the last young lady who occupied my
      place, and will you say it again to the next who follows me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to one of them! Mere compliments are for the others&mdash;not for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is for me, Mr. Mirabel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I have just offered you&mdash;a confession of the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily is startled by the tone in which he replies. He seems to be in
      earnest; not a vestige is left of the easy gayety of his manner. His face
      shows an expression of anxiety which she has never seen in it yet. "Do you
      believe me?" he asks in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tries to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When am I to hear you preach, Mr. Mirabel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He persists. "When you believe me," he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes add an emphasis to that reply which is not to be mistaken. Emily
      turns away from him, and notices Francine. She has left the dance, and is
      looking with marked attention at Emily and Mirabel. "I want to speak to
      you," she says, and beckons impatiently to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel whispers, "Don't go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily rises nevertheless&mdash;ready to avail herself of the first excuse
      for leaving him. Francine meets her half way, and takes her roughly by the
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" Emily asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you leave off flirting with Mr. Mirabel, and make yourself of
      some use."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Use your ears&mdash;and look at that girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      She points disdainfully to innocent Miss Plym. The rector's daughter
      possesses all the virtues, with one exception&mdash;the virtue of having
      an ear for music. When she sings, she is out of tune; and, when she plays,
      she murders time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can dance to such music as that?" says Francine. "Finish the waltz
      for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily naturally hesitates. "How can I take her place, unless she asks me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine laughs scornfully. "Say at once, you want to go back to Mr.
      Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I should have got up, when you beckoned to me," Emily
      rejoins, "if I had not wanted to get away from Mr. Mirabel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of resenting this sharp retort, Francine suddenly breaks into good
      humor. "Come along, you little spit-fire; I'll manage it for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leads Emily to the piano, and stops Miss Plym without a word of
      apology: "It's your turn to dance now. Here's Miss Brown waiting to
      relieve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia has not been unobservant, in her own quiet way, of what has been
      going on. Waiting until Francine and Miss Plym are out of hearing, she
      bends over Emily, and says, "My dear, I really do think Francine is in
      love with Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After having only been a week in the same house with him!" Emily
      exclaims.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate," said Cecilia, more smartly than usual, "she is jealous of
      <i>you</i>."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. FEIGNING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, Mr. Mirabel took two members of the circle at Monksmoor
      by surprise. One of them was Emily; and one of them was the master of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Emily alone in the garden before breakfast, he left his room and
      joined her. "Let me say one word," he pleaded, "before we go to breakfast.
      I am grieved to think that I was so unfortunate as to offend you, last
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's look of astonishment answered for her before she could speak.
      "What can I have said or done," she asked, "to make you think that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I breathe again!" he cried, with the boyish gayety of manner which
      was one of the secrets of his popularity among women. "I really feared
      that I had spoken thoughtlessly. It is a terrible confession for a
      clergyman to make&mdash;but it is not the less true that I am one of the
      most indiscreet men living. It is my rock ahead in life that I say the
      first thing which comes uppermost, without stopping to think. Being well
      aware of my own defects, I naturally distrust myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even in the pulpit?" Emily inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed with the readiest appreciation of the satire&mdash;although it
      was directed against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like that question," he said; "it tells me we are as good friends again
      as ever. The fact is, the sight of the congregation, when I get into the
      pulpit, has the same effect upon me that the sight of the footlights has
      on an actor. All oratory (though my clerical brethren are shy of
      confessing it) is acting&mdash;without the scenery and the costumes. Did
      you really mean it, last night, when you said you would like to hear me
      preach?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How very kind of you. I don't think myself the sermon is worth the
      sacrifice. (There is another specimen of my indiscreet way of talking!)
      What I mean is, that you will have to get up early on Sunday morning, and
      drive twelve miles to the damp and dismal little village, in which I
      officiate for a man with a rich wife who likes the climate of Italy. My
      congregation works in the fields all the week, and naturally enough goes
      to sleep in church on Sunday. I have had to counteract that. Not by
      preaching! I wouldn't puzzle the poor people with my eloquence for the
      world. No, no: I tell them little stories out of the Bible&mdash;in a nice
      easy gossiping way. A quarter of an hour is my limit of time; and, I am
      proud to say, some of them (mostly the women) do to a certain extent keep
      awake. If you and the other ladies decide to honor me, it is needless to
      say you shall have one of my grand efforts. What will be the effect on my
      unfortunate flock remains to be seen. I will have the church brushed up,
      and luncheon of course at the parsonage. Beans, bacon, and beer&mdash;I
      haven't got anything else in the house. Are you rich? I hope not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect I am quite as poor as you are, Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am delighted to hear it. (More of my indiscretion!) Our poverty is
      another bond between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could enlarge on this text, the breakfast bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Emily his arm, quite satisfied with the result of the morning's
      talk. In speaking seriously to her on the previous night, he had committed
      the mistake of speaking too soon. To amend this false step, and to recover
      his position in Emily's estimation, had been his object in view&mdash;and
      it had been successfully accomplished. At the breakfast-table that
      morning, the companionable clergyman was more amusing than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal being over, the company dispersed as usual&mdash;with the one
      exception of Mirabel. Without any apparent reason, he kept his place at
      the table. Mr. Wyvil, the most courteous and considerate of men, felt it
      an attention due to his guest not to leave the room first. All that he
      could venture to do was to give a little hint. "Have you any plans for the
      morning?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a plan that depends entirely on yourself," Mirabel answered; "and
      I am afraid of being as indiscreet as usual, if I mention it. Your
      charming daughter tells me you play on the violin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Modest Mr. Wyvil looked confused. "I hope you have not been annoyed," he
      said; "I practice in a distant room so that nobody may hear me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, I am eager to hear you! Music is my passion; and the violin
      is my favorite instrument."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil led the way to his room, positively blushing with pleasure.
      Since the death of his wife he had been sadly in want of a little
      encouragement. His daughters and his friends were careful&mdash;over-careful,
      as he thought&mdash;of intruding on him in his hours of practice. And, sad
      to say, his daughters and his friends were, from a musical point of view,
      perfectly right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Literature has hardly paid sufficient attention to a social phenomenon of
      a singularly perplexing kind. We hear enough, and more than enough, of
      persons who successfully cultivate the Arts&mdash;of the remarkable manner
      in which fitness for their vocation shows itself in early life, of the
      obstacles which family prejudice places in their way, and of the
      unremitting devotion which has led to the achievement of glorious results.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how many writers have noticed those other incomprehensible persons,
      members of families innocent for generations past of practicing Art or
      caring for Art, who have notwithstanding displayed from their earliest
      years the irresistible desire to cultivate poetry, painting, or music; who
      have surmounted obstacles, and endured disappointments, in the
      single-hearted resolution to devote their lives to an intellectual pursuit&mdash;being
      absolutely without the capacity which proves the vocation, and justifies
      the sacrifice. Here is Nature, "unerring Nature," presented in flat
      contradiction with herself. Here are men bent on performing feats of
      running, without having legs; and women, hopelessly barren, living in
      constant expectation of large families to the end of their days. The
      musician is not to be found more completely deprived than Mr. Wyvil of
      natural capacity for playing on an instrument&mdash;and, for twenty years
      past, it had been the pride and delight of his heart to let no day of his
      life go by without practicing on the violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I must be tiring you," he said politely&mdash;after having
      played without mercy for an hour and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      No: the insatiable amateur had his own purpose to gain, and was not
      exhausted yet. Mr. Wyvil got up to look for some more music. In that
      interval desultory conversation naturally took place. Mirabel contrived to
      give it the necessary direction&mdash;the direction of Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The most delightful girl I have met with for many a long year past!" Mr.
      Wyvil declared warmly. "I don't wonder at my daughter being so fond of
      her. She leads a solitary life at home, poor thing; and I am honestly glad
      to see her spirits reviving in my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An only child?" Mirabel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the necessary explanation that followed, Emily's isolated position in
      the world was revealed in few words. But one more discovery&mdash;the most
      important of all&mdash;remained to be made. Had she used a figure of
      speech in saying that she was as poor as Mirabel himself? or had she told
      him the shocking truth? He put the question with perfect delicacy&mdash;-but
      with unerring directness as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil, quoting his daughter's authority, described Emily's income as
      falling short even of two hundred a year. Having made that disheartening
      reply, he opened another music book. "You know this sonata, of course?" he
      said. The next moment, the violin was under his chin and the performance
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mirabel was, to all appearance, listening with the utmost attention,
      he was actually endeavoring to reconcile himself to a serious sacrifice of
      his own inclinations. If he remained much longer in the same house with
      Emily, the impression that she had produced on him would be certainly
      strengthened&mdash;and he would be guilty of the folly of making an offer
      of marriage to a woman who was as poor as himself. The one remedy that
      could be trusted to preserve him from such infatuation as this, was
      absence. At the end of the week, he had arranged to return to Vale Regis
      for his Sunday duty; engaging to join his friends again at Monksmoor on
      the Monday following. That rash promise, there could be no further doubt
      about it, must not be fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had arrived at this resolution, when the terrible activity of Mr.
      Wyvil's bow was suspended by the appearance of a third person in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's maid was charged with a neat little three-cornered note from her
      young lady, to be presented to her master. Wondering why his daughter
      should write to him, Mr. Wyvil opened the note, and was informed of
      Cecilia's motive in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAREST PAPA&mdash;I hear Mr. Mirabel is with you, and as this is a
      secret, I must write. Emily has received a very strange letter this
      morning, which puzzles her and alarms me. When you are quite at liberty,
      we shall be so much obliged if you will tell us how Emily ought to answer
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil stopped Mirabel, on the point of trying to escape from the
      music. "A little domestic matter to attend to," he said. "But we will
      finish the sonata first."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. CONSULTING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Out of the music room, and away from his violin, the sound side of Mr.
      Wyvil's character was free to assert itself. In his public and in his
      private capacity, he was an eminently sensible man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a member of parliament, he set an example which might have been
      followed with advantage by many of his colleagues. In the first place he
      abstained from hastening the downfall of representative institutions by
      asking questions and making speeches. In the second place, he was able to
      distinguish between the duty that he owed to his party, and the duty that
      he owed to his country. When the Legislature acted politically&mdash;that
      is to say, when it dealt with foreign complications, or electoral reforms&mdash;he
      followed his leader. When the Legislature acted socially&mdash;that is to
      say, for the good of the people&mdash;he followed his conscience. On the
      last occasion when the great Russian bugbear provoked a division, he voted
      submissively with his Conservative allies. But, when the question of
      opening museums and picture galleries on Sundays arrayed the two parties
      in hostile camps, he broke into open mutiny, and went over to the
      Liberals. He consented to help in preventing an extension of the
      franchise; but he refused to be concerned in obstructing the repeal of
      taxes on knowledge. "I am doubtful in the first case," he said, "but I am
      sure in the second." He was asked for an explanation: "Doubtful of what?
      and sure of what?" To the astonishment of his leader, he answered: "The
      benefit to the people." The same sound sense appeared in the transactions
      of his private life. Lazy and dishonest servants found that the gentlest
      of masters had a side to his character which took them by surprise. And,
      on certain occasions in the experience of Cecilia and her sister, the most
      indulgent of fathers proved to be as capable of saying No, as the sternest
      tyrant who ever ruled a fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Called into council by his daughter and his guest, Mr. Wyvil assisted them
      by advice which was equally wise and kind&mdash;but which afterward
      proved, under the perverse influence of circumstances, to be advice that
      he had better not have given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter to Emily which Cecilia had recommended to her father's
      consideration, had come from Netherwoods, and had been written by Alban
      Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured Emily that he had only decided on writing to her, after some
      hesitation, in the hope of serving interests which he did not himself
      understand, but which might prove to be interests worthy of consideration,
      nevertheless. Having stated his motive in these terms, he proceeded to
      relate what had passed between Miss Jethro and himself. On the subject of
      Francine, Alban only ventured to add that she had not produced a favorable
      impression on him, and that he could not think her likely, on further
      experience, to prove a desirable friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last leaf were added some lines, which Emily was at no loss how to
      answer. She had folded back the page, so that no eyes but her own should
      see how the poor drawing-master finished his letter: "I wish you all
      possible happiness, my dear, among your new friends; but don't forget the
      old friend who thinks of you, and dreams of you, and longs to see you
      again. The little world I live in is a dreary world, Emily, in your
      absence. Will you write to me now and then, and encourage me to hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil smiled, as he looked at the folded page, which hid the
      signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I may take it for granted," he said slyly, "that this gentleman
      really has your interests at heart? May I know who he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily answered the last question readily enough. Mr. Wyvil went on with
      his inquiries. "About the mysterious lady, with the strange name," he
      proceeded&mdash;"do you know anything of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily related what she knew; without revealing the true reason for Miss
      Jethro's departure from Netherwoods. In after years, it was one of her
      most treasured remembrances, that she had kept secret the melancholy
      confession which had startled her, on the last night of her life at
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil looked at Alban's letter again. "Do you know how Miss Jethro
      became acquainted with Mr. Mirabel?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't even know that they were acquainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it likely&mdash;if Mr. Morris had been talking to you
      instead of writing to you&mdash;that he might have said more than he has
      said in his letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia had hitherto remained a model of discretion. Seeing Emily
      hesitate, temptation overcame her. "Not a doubt of it, papa!" she declared
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Cecilia right?" Mr. Wyvil inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reminded in this way of her influence over Alban, Emily could only make
      one honest reply. She admitted that Cecilia was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil thereupon advised her not to express any opinion, until she was
      in a better position to judge for herself. "When you write to Mr. Morris,"
      he continued, "say that you will wait to tell him what you think of Miss
      Jethro, until you see him again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no prospect at present of seeing him again," Emily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can see Mr. Morris whenever it suits him to come here," Mr. Wyvil
      replied. "I will write and ask him to visit us, and you can inclose the
      invitation in your letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Wyvil, how good of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, papa, the very thing I was going to ask you to do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The excellent master of Monksmoor looked unaffectedly surprised. "What are
      you two young ladies making a fuss about?" he said. "Mr. Morris is a
      gentleman by profession; and&mdash;may I venture to say it, Miss Emily?&mdash;a
      valued friend of yours as well. Who has a better claim to be one of my
      guests?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia stopped her father as he was about to leave the room. "I suppose
      we mustn't ask Mr. Mirabel what he knows of Miss Jethro?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, what can you be thinking of? What right have we to question Mr.
      Mirabel about Miss Jethro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so very unsatisfactory, papa. There must be some reason why Emily
      and Mr. Mirabel ought not to meet&mdash;or why should Miss Jethro have
      been so very earnest about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jethro doesn't intend us to know why, Cecilia. It will perhaps come
      out in time. Wait for time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Left together, the girls discussed the course which Alban would probably
      take, on receiving Mr. Wyvil's invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will only be too glad," Cecilia asserted, "to have the opportunity of
      seeing you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt whether he will care about seeing me again, among strangers,"
      Emily replied. "And you forget that there are obstacles in his way. How is
      he to leave his class?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite easily! His class doesn't meet on the Saturday half-holiday. He can
      be here, if he starts early, in time for luncheon; and he can stay till
      Monday or Tuesday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is to take his place at the school?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Ladd, to be sure&mdash;if <i>you</i> make a point of it. Write to
      her, as well as to Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters being written&mdash;and the order having been given to prepare
      a room for the expected guest&mdash;Emily and Cecilia returned to the
      drawing-room. They found the elders of the party variously engaged&mdash;the
      men with newspapers, and the ladies with work. Entering the conservatory
      next, they discovered Cecilia's sister languishing among the flowers in an
      easy chair. Constitutional laziness, in some young ladies, assumes an
      invalid character, and presents the interesting spectacle of perpetual
      convalescence. The doctor declared that the baths at St. Moritz had cured
      Miss Julia. Miss Julia declined to agree with the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come into the garden with Emily and me," Cecilia said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily and you don't know what it is to be ill," Julia answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls left her, and joined the young people who were amusing
      themselves in the garden. Francine had taken possession of Mirabel, and
      had condemned him to hard labor in swinging her. He made an attempt to get
      away when Emily and Cecilia approached, and was peremptorily recalled to
      his duty. "Higher!" cried Miss de Sor, in her hardest tones of authority.
      "I want to swing higher than anybody else!" Mirabel submitted with
      gentleman-like resignation, and was rewarded by tender encouragement
      expressed in a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you see that?" Cecilia whispered. "He knows how rich she is&mdash;I
      wonder whether he will marry her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily smiled. "I doubt it, while he is in this house," she said. "You are
      as rich as Francine&mdash;and don't forget that you have other attractions
      as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia shook her head. "Mr. Mirabel is very nice," she admitted; "but I
      wouldn't marry him. Would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily secretly compared Alban with Mirabel. "Not for the world!" she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was the day of Mirabel's departure. His admirers among the
      ladies followed him out to the door, at which Mr. Wyvil's carriage was
      waiting. Francine threw a nosegay after the departing guest as he got in.
      "Mind you come back to us on Monday!" she said. Mirabel bowed and thanked
      her; but his last look was for Emily, standing apart from the others at
      the top of the steps. Francine said nothing; her lips closed convulsively&mdash;she
      turned suddenly pale.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. SPEECHIFYING.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      On the Monday, a plowboy from Vale Regis arrived at Monksmoor.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In respect of himself, he was a person beneath notice. In respect of his
      errand, he was sufficiently important to cast a gloom over the household.
      The faithless Mirabel had broken his engagement, and the plowboy was the
      herald of misfortune who brought his apology. To his great disappointment
      (he wrote) he was detained by the affairs of his parish. He could only
      trust to Mr. Wyvil's indulgence to excuse him, and to communicate his
      sincere sense of regret (on scented note paper) to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody believed in the affairs of the parish&mdash;with the exception
      of Francine. "Mr. Mirabel has made the best excuse he could think of for
      shortening his visit; and I don't wonder at it," she said, looking
      significantly at Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was playing with one of the dogs; exercising him in the tricks which
      he had learned. She balanced a morsel of sugar on his nose&mdash;and had
      no attention to spare for Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, as the mistress of the house, felt it her duty to interfere.
      "That is a strange remark to make," she answered. "Do you mean to say that
      we have driven Mr. Mirabel away from us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accuse nobody," Francine began with spiteful candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now she's going to accuse everybody!" Emily interposed, addressing
      herself facetiously to the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when girls are bent on fascinating men, whether they like it or not,"
      Francine proceeded, "men have only one alternative&mdash;they must keep
      out of the way." She looked again at Emily, more pointedly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even gentle Cecilia resented this. "Whom do you refer to?" she said
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear!" Emily remonstrated, "need you ask?" She glanced at Francine as
      she spoke, and then gave the dog his signal. He tossed up the sugar, and
      caught it in his mouth. His audience applauded him&mdash;and so, for that
      time, the skirmish ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the letters of the next morning's delivery, arrived Alban's reply.
      Emily's anticipations proved to be correct. The drawing-master's du ties
      would not permit him to leave Netherwoods; and he, like Mirabel, sent his
      apologies. His short letter to Emily contained no further allusion to Miss
      Jethro; it began and ended on the first page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been disappointed by the tone of reserve in which Emily had written
      to him, under Mr. Wyvil's advice? Or (as Cecilia suggested) had his
      detention at the school so bitterly disappointed him that he was too
      disheartened to write at any length? Emily made no attempt to arrive at a
      conclusion, either one way or the other. She seemed to be in depressed
      spirits; and she spoke superstitiously, for the first time in Cecilia's
      experience of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like this reappearance of Miss Jethro," she said. "If the mystery
      about that woman is ever cleared up, it will bring trouble and sorrow to
      me&mdash;and I believe, in his own secret heart, Alban Morris thinks so
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Write, and ask him," Cecilia suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is so kind and so unwilling to distress me," Emily answered, "that he
      wouldn't acknowledge it, even if I am right."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the week, the course of private life at Monksmoor
      suffered an interruption&mdash;due to the parliamentary position of the
      master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insatiable appetite for making and hearing speeches, which represents
      one of the marked peculiarities of the English race (including their
      cousins in the United States), had seized on Mr. Wyvil's constituents.
      There was to be a political meeting at the market hall, in the neighboring
      town; and the member was expected to make an oration, passing in review
      contemporary events at home and abroad. "Pray don't think of accompanying
      me," the good man said to his guests. "The hall is badly ventilated, and
      the speeches, including my own, will not be worth hearing."
    </p>
    <p>
      This humane warning was ungratefully disregarded. The gentlemen were all
      interested in "the objects of the meeting"; and the ladies were firm in
      the resolution not to be left at home by themselves. They dressed with a
      view to the large assembly of spectators before whom they were about to
      appear; and they outtalked the men on political subjects, all the way to
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most delightful of surprises was in store for them, when they reached
      the market hall. Among the crowd of ordinary gentlemen, waiting under the
      portico until the proceedings began, appeared one person of distinction,
      whose title was "Reverend," and whose name was Mirabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was the first to discover him. She darted up the steps and held
      out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This <i>is</i> a pleasure!" she cried. "Have you come here to see&mdash;"
      she was about to say Me, but, observing the strangers round her, altered
      the word to Us. "Please give me your arm," she whispered, before her young
      friends had arrived within hearing. "I am so frightened in a crowd!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held fast by Mirabel, and kept a jealous watch on him. Was it only her
      fancy? or did she detect a new charm in his smile when he spoke to Emily?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was possible to decide, the time for the meeting had arrived.
      Mr. Wyvil's friends were of course accommodated with seats on the
      platform. Francine, still insisting on her claim to Mirabel's arm, got a
      chair next to him. As she seated herself, she left him free for a moment.
      In that moment, the infatuated man took an empty chair on the other side
      of him, and placed it for Emily. He communicated to that hated rival the
      information which he ought to have reserved for Francine. "The committee
      insist," he said, "on my proposing one of the Resolutions. I promise not
      to bore you; mine shall be the shortest speech delivered at the meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the earlier speakers not one was inspired by a feeling of mercy for
      the audience. The chairman reveled in words. The mover and seconder of the
      first Resolution (not having so much as the ghost of an idea to trouble
      either of them), poured out language in flowing and overflowing streams,
      like water from a perpetual spring. The heat exhaled by the crowded
      audience was already becoming insufferable. Cries of "Sit down!" assailed
      the orator of the moment. The chairman was obliged to interfere. A man at
      the back of the hall roared out, "Ventilation!" and broke a window with
      his stick. He was rewarded with three rounds of cheers; and was ironically
      invited to mount the platform and take the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these embarrassing circumstances, Mirabel rose to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He secured silence, at the outset, by a humorous allusion to the prolix
      speaker who had preceded him. "Look at the clock, gentlemen," he said;
      "and limit my speech to an interval of ten minutes." The applause which
      followed was heard, through the broken window, in the street. The boys
      among the mob outside intercepted the flow of air by climbing on each
      other's shoulders and looking in at the meeting, through the gaps left by
      the shattered glass. Having proposed his Resolution with discreet brevity
      of speech, Mirabel courted popularity on the plan adopted by the late Lord
      Palmerston in the House of Commons&mdash;he told stories, and made jokes,
      adapted to the intelligence of the dullest people who were listening to
      him. The charm of his voice and manner completed his success. Punctually
      at the tenth minute, he sat down amid cries of "Go on." Francine was the
      first to take his hand, and to express admiration mutely by pressing it.
      He returned the pressure&mdash;but he looked at the wrong lady&mdash;the
      lady on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she made no complaint, he instantly saw that Emily was overcome
      by the heat. Her lips were white, and her eyes were closing. "Let me take
      you out," he said, "or you will faint."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine started to her feet to follow them. The lower order of the
      audience, eager for amusement, put their own humorous construction on the
      young lady's action. They roared with laughter. "Let the parson and his
      sweetheart be," they called out; "two's company, miss, and three isn't."
      Mr. Wyvil interposed his authority and rebuked them. A lady seated behind
      Francine interfered to good purpose by giving her a chair, which placed
      her out of sight of the audience. Order was restored&mdash;and the
      proceedings were resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the conclusion of the meeting, Mirabel and Emily were found waiting for
      their friends at the door. Mr. Wyvil innocently added fuel to the fire
      that was burning in Francine. He insisted that Mirabel should return to
      Monksmoor, and offered him a seat in the carriage at Emily's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening, when they all met at dinner, there appeared a change
      in Miss de Sor which surprised everybody but Mirabel. She was gay and
      good-humored, and especially amiable and attentive to Emily&mdash;who sat
      opposite to her at the table. "What did you and Mr. Mirabel talk about
      while you were away from us?" she asked innocently. "Politics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily readily adopted Francine's friendly tone. "Would you have talked
      politics, in my place?" she asked gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your place, I should have had the most delightful of companions,"
      Francine rejoined; "I wish I had been overcome by the heat too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel&mdash;attentively observing her&mdash;acknowledged the compliment
      by a bow, and left Emily to continue the conversation. In perfect good
      faith she owned to having led Mirabel to talk of himself. She had heard
      from Cecilia that his early life had been devoted to various occupations,
      and she was interested in knowing how circumstances had led him into
      devoting himself to the Church. Francine listened with the outward
      appearance of implicit belief, and with the inward conviction that Emily
      was deliberately deceiving her. When the little narrative was at an end,
      she was more agreeable than ever. She admired Emily's dress, and she
      rivaled Cecilia in enjoyment of the good things on the table; she
      entertained Mirabel with humorous anecdotes of the priests at St. Domingo,
      and was so interested in the manufacture of violins, ancient and modern,
      that Mr. Wyvil promised to show her his famous collection of instruments,
      after dinner. Her overflowing amiability included even poor Miss Darnaway
      and the absent brothers and sisters. She heard with flattering sympathy,
      how they had been ill and had got well again; what amusing tricks they
      played, what alarming accidents happened to them, and how remarkably
      clever they were&mdash;"including, I do assure you, dear Miss de Sor, the
      baby only ten months old." When the ladies rose to retire, Francine was,
      socially speaking, the heroine of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the violins were in course of exhibition, Mirabel found an
      opportunity of speaking to Emily, unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you said, or done, anything to offend Miss de Sor?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever!" Emily declared, startled by the question. "What makes
      you think I have offended her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been trying to find a reason for the change in her," Mirabel
      answered&mdash;"especially the change toward yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;she means mischief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mischief of what sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a sort which may expose her to discovery&mdash;unless she disarms
      suspicion at the outset. That is (as I believe) exactly what she has been
      doing this evening. I needn't warn you to be on your guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the next day Emily was on the watch for events&mdash;and nothing
      happened. Not the slightest appearance of jealousy betrayed itself in
      Francine. She made no attempt to attract to herself the attentions of
      Mirabel; and she showed no hostility to Emily, either by word, look, or
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ........
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after, an event occurred at Netherwoods. Alban Morris received an
      anonymous letter, addressed to him in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A certain young lady, in whom you are supposed to be interested, is
      forgetting you in your absence. If you are not mean enough to allow
      yourself to be supplanted by another man, join the party at Monksmoor
      before it is too late."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. COOKING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the political meeting was a day of departures, at the
      pleasant country house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Darnaway was recalled to the nursery at home. The old squire who did
      justice to Mr. Wyvil's port-wine went away next, having guests to
      entertain at his own house. A far more serious loss followed. The three
      dancing men had engagements which drew them to new spheres of activity in
      other drawing-rooms. They said, with the same dreary grace of manner,
      "Very sorry to go"; they drove to the railway, arrayed in the same perfect
      traveling suits of neutral tint; and they had but one difference of
      opinion among them&mdash;each firmly believed that he was smoking the best
      cigar to be got in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after these departures would have been a dull morning indeed,
      but for the presence of Mirabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was over, the invalid Miss Julia established herself on the
      sofa with a novel. Her father retired to the other end of the house, and
      profaned the art of music on music's most expressive instrument. Left with
      Emily, Cecilia, and Francine, Mirabel made one of his happy suggestions.
      "We are thrown on our own resources," he said. "Let us distinguish
      ourselves by inventing some entirely new amusement for the day. You young
      ladies shall sit in council&mdash;and I will be secretary." He turned to
      Cecilia. "The meeting waits to hear the mistress of the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Modest Cecilia appealed to her school friends for help; addressing herself
      in the first instance (by the secretary's advice) to Francine, as the
      eldest. They all noticed another change in this variable young person. She
      was silent and subdued; and she said wearily, "I don't care what we do&mdash;shall
      we go out riding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The unanswerable objection to riding as a form of amusement, was that it
      had been more than once tried already. Something clever and surprising was
      anticipated from Emily when it came to her turn. She, too, disappointed
      expectation. "Let us sit under the trees," was all that she could suggest,
      "and ask Mr. Mirabel to tell us a story."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel laid down his pen and took it on himself to reject this proposal.
      "Remember," he remonstrated, "that I have an interest in the diversions of
      the day. You can't expect me to be amused by my own story. I appeal to
      Miss Wyvil to invent a pleasure which will include the secretary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia blushed and looked uneasy. "I think I have got an idea," she
      announced, after some hesitation. "May I propose that we all go to the
      keeper's lodge?" There her courage failed her, and she hesitated again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel gravely registered the proposal, as far as it went. "What are we
      to do when we get to the keeper's lodge?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are to ask the keeper's wife," Cecilia proceeded, "to lend us her
      kitchen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To lend us her kitchen," Mirabel repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are we to do in the kitchen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia looked down at her pretty hands crossed on her lap, and answered
      softly, "Cook our own luncheon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was an entirely new amusement, in the most attractive sense of the
      words! Here was charming Cecilia's interest in the pleasures of the table
      so happily inspired, that the grateful meeting offered its tribute of
      applause&mdash;even including Francine. The members of the council were
      young; their daring digestions contemplated without fear the prospect of
      eating their own amateur cookery. The one question that troubled them now
      was what they were to cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can make an omelet," Cecilia ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is any cold chicken to be had," Emily added, "I undertake to
      follow the omelet with a mayonnaise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are clergymen in the Church of England who are even clever enough
      to fry potatoes," Mirabel announced&mdash;"and I am one of them. What
      shall we have next? A pudding? Miss de Sor, can you make a pudding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine exhibited another new side to her character&mdash;a diffident and
      humble side. "I am ashamed to say I don't know how to cook anything," she
      confessed; "you had better leave me out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cecilia was now in her element. Her plan of operations was wide enough
      even to include Francine. "You shall wash the lettuce, my dear, and stone
      the olives for Emily's mayonnaise. Don't be discouraged! You shall have a
      companion; we will send to the rectory for Miss Plym&mdash;the very person
      to chop parsley and shallot for my omelet. Oh, Emily, what a morning we
      are going to have!" Her lovely blue eyes sparkled with joy; she gave Emily
      a kiss which Mirabel must have been more or less than man not to have
      coveted. "I declare," cried Cecilia, completely losing her head, "I'm so
      excited, I don't know what to do with myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's intimate knowledge of her friend applied the right remedy. "You
      don't know what to do with yourself?" she repeated. "Have you no sense of
      duty? Give the cook your orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia instantly recovered her presence of mind. She sat down at the
      writing-table, and made out a list of eatable productions in the animal
      and vegetable world, in which every other word was underlined two or three
      times over. Her serious face was a sight to see, when she rang for the
      cook, and the two held a privy council in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to the keeper's lodge, the young mistress of the house headed a
      procession of servants carrying the raw materials. Francine followed, held
      in custody by Miss Plym&mdash;who took her responsibilities seriously, and
      clamored for instruction in the art of chopping parsley. Mirabel and Emily
      were together, far behind; they were the only two members of the company
      whose minds were not occupied in one way or another by the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This child's play of ours doesn't seem to interest you," Mirabel
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thinking," Emily answered, "of what you said to me about Francine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can say something more," he rejoined. "When I noticed the change in her
      at dinner, I told you she meant mischief. There is another change to-day,
      which suggests to my mind that the mischief is done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And directed against me?" Emily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel made no direct reply. It was impossible for <i>him</i> to remind
      her that she had, no matter how innocently, exposed herself to the jealous
      hatred of Francine. "Time will tell us, what we don't know now," he
      replied evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have faith in time, Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The greatest faith. Time is the inveterate enemy of deceit. Sooner or
      later, every hidden thing is a thing doomed to discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without exception?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he answered positively, "without exception."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Francine stopped and looked back at them. Did she think
      that Emily and Mirabel had been talking together long enough? Miss Plym&mdash;with
      the parsley still on her mind&mdash;-advanced to consult Emil y's
      experience. The two walked on together, leaving Mirabel to overtake
      Francine. He saw, in her first look at him, the effort that it cost her to
      suppress those emotions which the pride of women is most deeply interested
      in concealing. Before a word had passed, he regretted that Emily had left
      them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I had your cheerful disposition," she began, abruptly. "I am out
      of spirits or out of temper&mdash;I don't know which; and I don't know
      why. Do you ever trouble yourself with thinking of the future?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As seldom as possible, Miss de Sor. In such a situation as mine, most
      people have prospects&mdash;I have none."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke gravely, conscious of not feeling at ease on his side. If he had
      been the most modest man that ever lived, he must have seen in Francine's
      face that she loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had first been presented to each other, she was still under the
      influence of the meanest instincts in her scheming and selfish nature. She
      had thought to herself, "With my money to help him, that man's celebrity
      would do the rest; the best society in England would be glad to receive
      Mirabel's wife." As the days passed, strong feeling had taken the place of
      those contemptible aspirations: Mirabel had unconsciously inspired the one
      passion which was powerful enough to master Francine&mdash;sensual
      passion. Wild hopes rioted in her. Measureless desires which she had never
      felt before, united themselves with capacities for wickedness, which had
      been the horrid growth of a few nights&mdash;capacities which suggested
      even viler attempts to rid herself of a supposed rivalry than slandering
      Emily by means of an anonymous letter. Without waiting for it to be
      offered, she took Mirabel's arm, and pressed it to her breast as they
      slowly walked on. The fear of discovery which had troubled her after she
      had sent her base letter to the post, vanished at that inspiriting moment.
      She bent her head near enough to him when he spoke to feel his breath on
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a strange similarity," she said softly, "between your position
      and mine. Is there anything cheering in <i>my</i> prospects? I am far away
      from home&mdash;my father and mother wouldn't care if they never saw me
      again. People talk about my money! What is the use of money to such a
      lonely wretch as I am? Suppose I write to London, and ask the lawyer if I
      may give it all away to some deserving person? Why not to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Miss de Sor&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything wrong, Mr. Mirabel, in wishing that I could make you a
      prosperous man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not even talk of such a thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How proud you are!" she said submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I can't bear to think of you in that miserable village&mdash;a
      position so unworthy of your talents and your claims! And you tell me I
      must not talk about it. Would you have said that to Emily, if she was as
      anxious as I am to see you in your right place in the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have answered her exactly as I have answered you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will never embarrass you, Mr. Mirabel, by being as sincere as I am.
      Emily can keep her own secrets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she to blame for doing that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends on your feeling for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What feeling do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you heard she was engaged to be married?" Francine suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel's manner&mdash;studiously cold and formal thus far&mdash;altered
      on a sudden. He looked with unconcealed anxiety at Francine. "Do you say
      that seriously?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said 'suppose.' I don't exactly know that she is engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What <i>do</i> you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how interested you are in Emily! She is admired by some people. Are
      you one of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel's experience of women warned him to try silence as a means of
      provoking her into speaking plainly. The experiment succeeded: Francine
      returned to the question that he had put to her, and abruptly answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may believe me or not, as you like&mdash;I know of a man who is in
      love with her. He has had his opportunities; and he has made good use of
      them. Would you like to know who he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to know anything which you may wish to tell me." He did his
      best to make the reply in a tone of commonplace politeness&mdash;and he
      might have succeeded in deceiving a man. The woman's quicker ear told her
      that he was angry. Francine took the full advantage of that change in her
      favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid your good opinion of Emily will be shaken," she quietly
      resumed, "when I tell you that she has encouraged a man who is only
      drawing-master at a school. At the same time, a person in her
      circumstances&mdash;I mean she has no money&mdash;ought not to be very
      hard to please. Of course she has never spoken to you of Mr. Alban
      Morris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      Only four words&mdash;but they satisfied Francine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thing wanting to complete the obstacle which she had now placed in
      Emily's way, was that Alban Morris should enter on the scene. He might
      hesitate; but, if he was really fond of Emily, the anonymous letter would
      sooner or later bring him to Monksmoor. In the meantime, her object was
      gained. She dropped Mirabel's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is the lodge," she said gayly&mdash;"I declare Cecilia has got an
      apron on already! Come, and cook."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. SOUNDING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mirabel left Francine to enter the lodge by herself. His mind was
      disturbed: he felt the importance of gaining time for reflection before he
      and Emily met again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keeper's garden was at the back of the lodge. Passing through the
      wicket-gate, he found a little summer-house at a turn in the path. Nobody
      was there: he went in and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals, he had even yet encouraged himself to underrate the true
      importance of the feeling which Emily had awakened in him. There was an
      end to all self-deception now. After what Francine had said to him, this
      shallow and frivolous man no longer resisted the all-absorbing influence
      of love. He shrank under the one terrible question that forced itself on
      his mind:&mdash;Had that jealous girl spoken the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      In what process of investigation could he trust, to set this anxiety at
      rest? To apply openly to Emily would be to take a liberty, which Emily was
      the last person in the world to permit. In his recent intercourse with her
      he had felt more strongly than ever the importance of speaking with
      reserve. He had been scrupulously careful to take no unfair advantage of
      his opportunity, when he had removed her from the meeting, and when they
      had walked together, with hardly a creature to observe them, in the lonely
      outskirts of the town. Emily's gaiety and good humor had not led him
      astray: he knew that these were bad signs, viewed in the interests of
      love. His one hope of touching her deeper sympathies was to wait for the
      help that might yet come from time and chance. With a bitter sigh, he
      resigned himself to the necessity of being as agreeable and amusing as
      ever: it was just possible that he might lure her into alluding to Alban
      Morris, if he began innocently by making her laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rose to return to the lodge, the keeper's little terrier, prowling
      about the garden, looked into the summer-house. Seeing a stranger, the dog
      showed his teeth and growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel shrank back against the wall behind him, trembling in every limb.
      His eyes stared in terror as the dog came nearer: barking in high triumph
      over the discovery of a frightened man whom he could bully. Mirabel called
      out for help. A laborer at work in the garden ran to the place&mdash;and
      stopped with a broad grin of amusement at seeing a grown man terrified by
      a barking dog. "Well," he said to himself, after Mirabel had passed out
      under protection, "there goes a coward if ever there was one yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel waited a minute behind the lodge to recover himself. He had been
      so completely unnerved that his hair was wet with perspiration. While he
      used his handkerchief, he shuddered at other recollections than the
      recollection of the dog. "After that night at the inn," he thought, "the
      least thing frightens me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was received by the young ladies with cries of derisive welcome. "Oh,
      for shame! for shame! here are the potatoes already cut, and nobody to fry
      them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel assumed the mask of cheerfulness&mdash;with the desperate
      resolution of an actor, amusing his audience at a time of domestic
      distress. He astonished the keeper's wife by showing that he really knew
      how to use her frying-pan. Cecilia's omelet was tough&mdash;but the young
      ladies ate it. Emily's mayonnaise sauce was almost as liquid as water&mdash;they
      swallowed it nevertheless by the help of spoons. The potatoes followed,
      crisp and dry and delicious&mdash;and Mirabel became more popular than
      ever. "He is the only one of us," Cecilia sadly acknowledged, "who knows
      how to cook."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they all left the lodge for a stroll in the park, Francine attached
      herself to Cecilia and Miss Plym. She resigned Mirabel to Emily&mdash;in
      the happy belief that she had paved the way for a misunderstanding between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merriment at the luncheon table had revived Emily's good spirits. She
      had a light-hearted remembrance of the failure of her sauce. Mirabel saw
      her smiling to herself. "May I ask what amuses you?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of the debt of gratitude that we owe to Mr. Wyvil," she
      replied. "If he had not persuaded you to return to Monksmoor, we should
      never have seen the famous Mr. Mirabel with a frying pan in his hand, and
      never have tasted the only good dish at our luncheon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel tried vainly to adopt his companion's easy tone. Now that he was
      alone with her, the doubts that Francine had aroused shook the prudent
      resolution at which he had arrived in the garden. He ran the risk, and
      told Emily plainly why he had returned to Mr. Wyvil's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Although I am sensible of our host's kindness," he answered, "I should
      have gone back to my parsonage&mdash;but for You."
    </p>
    <p>
      She declined to understand him seriously. "Then the affairs of your parish
      are neglected&mdash;and I am to blame!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I the first man who has neglected his duties for your sake?" he asked.
      "I wonder whether the masters at school had the heart to report you when
      you neglected your lessons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of Alban&mdash;and betrayed herself by a heightened color. The
      moment after, she changed the subject. Mirabel could no longer resist the
      conclusion that Francine had told him the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you leave us," she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow is Saturday&mdash;I must go back as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how will your deserted parish receive you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a desperate effort to be as amusing as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of preserving my popularity," he said, "while I have a cask in
      the cellar, and a few spare sixpences in my pocket. The public spirit of
      my parishioners asks for nothing but money and beer. Before I went to that
      wearisome meeting, I told my housekeeper that I was going to make a speech
      about reform. She didn't know what I meant. I explained that reform might
      increase the number of British citizens who had the right of voting at
      elections for parliament. She brightened up directly. 'Ah,' she said,
      'I've heard my husband talk about elections. The more there are of them (<i>he</i>
      says) the more money he'll get for his vote. I'm all for reform.' On my
      way out of the house, I tried the man who works in my garden on the same
      subject. He didn't look at the matter from the housekeeper's sanguine
      point of view. 'I don't deny that parliament once gave me a good dinner
      for nothing at the public-house,' he admitted. 'But that was years ago&mdash;and
      (you'll excuse me, sir) I hear nothing of another dinner to come. It's a
      matter of opinion, of course. I don't myself believe in reform.' There are
      specimens of the state of public spirit in our village!" He paused. Emily
      was listening&mdash;but he had not succeeded in choosing a subject that
      amused her. He tried a topic more nearly connected with his own interests;
      the topic of the future. "Our good friend has asked me to prolong my
      visit, after Sunday's duties are over," he said. "I hope I shall find you
      here, next week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will the affairs of your parish allow you to come back?" Emily asked
      mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The affairs of my parish&mdash;if you force me to confess it&mdash;were
      only an excuse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An excuse for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An excuse for keeping away from Monksmoor&mdash;in the interests of my
      own tranquillity. The experiment has failed. While you are here, I can't
      keep away."
    </p>
    <p>
      She still declined to understand him seriously. "Must I tell you in plain
      words that flattery is thrown away on me?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flattery is not offered to you," he answered gravely. "I beg your pardon
      for having led to the mistake by talking of myself." Having appealed to
      her indulgence by that act of submission, he ventured on another distant
      allusion to the man whom he hated and feared. "Shall I meet any friends of
      yours," he resumed, "when I return on Monday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only meant to ask if Mr. Wyvil expects any new guests?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he put the question, Cecilia's voice was heard behind them, calling to
      Emily. They both turned round. Mr. Wyvil had joined his daughter and her
      two friends. He advanced to meet Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have some news for you that you little expect," he said. "A telegram
      has just arrived from Netherwoods. Mr. Alban Morris has got leave of
      absence, and is coming here to-morrow."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. COMPETING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time at Monksmoor had advanced to the half hour before dinner, on Saturday
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia and Francine, Mr. Wyvil and Mirabel, were loitering in the
      conservatory. In the drawing-room, Emily had been considerately left alone
      with Alban. He had missed the early train from Netherwoods; but he had
      arrived in time to dress for dinner, and to offer the necessary
      explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had been possible for Alban to allude to the anonymous letter, he
      might have owned that his first impulse had led him to destroy it, and to
      assert his confidence in Emily by refusing Mr. Wyvil's invitation. But try
      as he might to forget them, the base words that he had read remained in
      his memory. Irritating him at the outset, they had ended in rousing his
      jealousy. Under that delusive influence, he persuaded himself that he had
      acted, in the first instance, without due consideration. It was surely his
      interest&mdash;it might even be his duty&mdash;to go to Mr. Wyvil's house,
      and judge for himself. After some last wretched moments of hesitation, he
      had decided on effecting a compromise with his own better sense, by
      consulting Miss Ladd. That excellent lady did exactly what he had expected
      her to do. She made arrangements which granted him leave of absence, from
      the Saturday to the Tuesday following. The excuse which had served him, in
      telegraphing to Mr. Wyvil, must now be repeated, in accounting for his
      unexpected appearance to Emily. "I found a person to take charge of my
      class," he said; "and I gladly availed myself of the opportunity of seeing
      you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      After observing him attentively, while he was speaking to her, Emily
      owned, with her customary frankness, that she had noticed something in his
      manner which left her not quite at her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," she said, "if there is any foundation for a doubt that has
      troubled me?" To his unutterable relief, she at once explained what the
      doubt was. "I am afraid I offended you, in replying to your letter about
      Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, Alban could enjoy the luxury of speaking unreservedly. He
      confessed that Emily's letter had disappointed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expected you to answer me with less reserve," he replied; "and I began
      to think I had acted rashly in writing to you at all. When there is a
      better opportunity, I may have a word to say&mdash;" He was apparently
      interrupted by something that he saw in the conservatory. Looking that
      way, Emily perceived that Mirabel was the object which had attracted
      Alban's attention. The vile anonymous letter was in his mind again.
      Without a preliminary word to prepare Emily, he suddenly changed the
      subject. "How do you like the clergyman?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much indeed," she replied, without the slightest embarrassment. "Mr.
      Mirabel is clever and agreeable&mdash;and not at all spoiled by his
      success. I am sure," she said innocently, "you will like him too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's face answered her unmistakably in the negative sense&mdash;but
      Emily's attention was drawn the other way by Francine. She joined them at
      the moment, on the lookout for any signs of an encouraging result which
      her treachery might already have produced. Alban had been inclined to
      suspect her when he had received the letter. He rose and bowed as she
      approached. Something&mdash;he was unable to realize what it was&mdash;told
      him, in the moment when they looked at each other, that his suspicion had
      hit the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the conservatory the ever-amiable Mirabel had left his friends for a
      while in search of flowers for Cecilia. She turned to her father when they
      were alone, and asked him which of the gentlemen was to take her in to
      dinner&mdash;Mr. Mirabel or Mr. Morris?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Morris, of course," he answered. "He is the new guest&mdash;and he
      turns out to be more than the equal, socially-speaking, of our other
      friend. When I showed him his room, I asked if he was related to a man who
      bore the same name&mdash;a fellow student of mine, years and years ago, at
      college. He is my friend's younger son; one of a ruined family&mdash;but
      persons of high distinction in their day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel returned with the flowers, just as dinner was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to take Emily to-day," Cecilia said to him, leading the way out
      of the conservatory. As they entered the drawing-room, Alban was just
      offering his arm to Emily. "Papa gives you to me, Mr. Morris," Cecilia
      explained pleasantly. Alban hesitated, apparently not understanding the
      allusion. Mirabel interfered with his best grace: "Mr. Wyvil offers you
      the honor of taking his daughter to the dining-room." Alban's face
      darkened ominously, as the elegant little clergyman gave his arm to Emily,
      and followed Mr. Wyvil and Francine out of the room. Cecilia looked at her
      silent and surly companion, and almost envied her lazy sister, dining&mdash;under
      cover of a convenient headache&mdash;in her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having already made up his mind that Alban Morris required careful
      handling, Mirabel waited a little before he led the conversation as usual.
      Between the soup and the fish, he made an interesting confession,
      addressed to Emily in the strictest confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have taken a fancy to your friend Mr. Morris," he said. "First
      impressions, in my case, decide everything; I like people or dislike them
      on impulse. That man appeals to my sympathies. Is he a good talker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say Yes," Emily answered prettily, "if <i>you</i> were not
      present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel was not to be beaten, even by a woman, in the art of paying
      compliments. He looked admiringly at Alban (sitting opposite to him), and
      said: "Let us listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      This flattering suggestion not only pleased Emily&mdash;it artfully served
      Mirabel's purpose. That is to say, it secured him an opportunity for
      observation of what was going on at the other side of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban's instincts as a gentleman had led him to control his irritation and
      to regret that he had suffered it to appear. Anxious to please, he
      presented himself at his best. Gentle Cecilia forgave and forgot the angry
      look which had startled her. Mr. Wyvil was delighted with the son of his
      old friend. Emily felt secretly proud of the good opinions which her
      admirer was gathering; and Francine saw with pleasure that he was
      asserting his claim to Emily's preference, in the way of all others which
      would be most likely to discourage his rival. These various impressions&mdash;produced
      while Alban's enemy was ominously silent&mdash;began to suffer an
      imperceptible change, from the moment when Mirabel decided that his time
      had come to take the lead. A remark made by Alban offered him the chance
      for which he had been on the watch. He agreed with the remark; he enlarged
      on the remark; he was brilliant and familiar, and instructive and amusing&mdash;and
      still it was all due to the remark. Alban's temper was once more severely
      tried. Mirabel's mischievous object had not escaped his penetration. He
      did his best to put obstacles in the adversary's way&mdash;and was
      baffled, time after time, with the readiest ingenuity. If he interrupted&mdash;the
      sweet-tempered clergyman submitted, and went on. If he differed&mdash;modest
      Mr. Mirabel said, in the most amiable manner, "I daresay I am wrong," and
      handled the topic from his opponent's point of view. Never had such a
      perfect Christian sat before at Mr. Wyvil's table: not a hard word, not an
      impatient look, escaped him. The longer Alban resisted, the more surely he
      lost ground in the general estimation. Cecilia was disappointed; Emily was
      grieved; Mr. Wyvil's favorable opinion began to waver; Francine was
      disgusted. When dinner was over, and the carriage was waiting to take the
      shepherd back to his flock by moonlight, Mirabel's triumph was complete.
      He had made Alban the innocent means of publicly exhibiting his perfect
      temper and perfect politeness, under their best and brightest aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that day ended. Sunday promised to pass quietly, in the absence of
      Mirabel. The morning came&mdash;and it seemed doubtful whether the promise
      would be fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine had passed an uneasy night. No such encouraging result as she had
      anticipated had hitherto followed the appearance of Alban Morris at
      Monksmoor. He had clumsily allowed Mirabel to improve his position&mdash;while
      he had himself lost ground&mdash;in Emily's estimation. If this first
      disastrous consequence of the meeting between the two men was permitted to
      repeat itself on future occasions, Emily and Mirabel would be brought more
      closely together, and Alban himself would be the unhappy cause of it.
      Francine rose, on the Sunday morning, before the table was laid for
      breakfast&mdash;resolved to try the effect of a timely word of advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her bedroom was situated in the front of the house. The man she was
      looking for presently passed within her range of view from the window, on
      his way to take a morning walk in the park. She followed him immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat and bowed&mdash;without speaking, and without looking at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We resemble each other in one particular," she proceeded, graciously; "we
      both like to breathe the fresh air before breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said exactly what common politeness obliged him to say, and no more&mdash;he
      said, "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some girls might have been discouraged. Francine went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no fault of mine, Mr. Morris, that we have not been better friends.
      For some reason, into which I don't presume to inquire, you seem to
      distrust me. I really don't know what I have done to deserve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure of that?" he asked&mdash;eying her suddenly and searchingly
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hard face settled into a rigid look; her eyes met his eyes with a
      stony defiant stare. Now, for the first time, she knew that he suspected
      her of having written the anonymous letter. Every evil quality in her
      nature steadily defied him. A hardened old woman could not have sustained
      the shock of discovery with a more devilish composure than this girl
      displayed. "Perhaps you will explain yourself," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>have</i> explained myself," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I must be content," she rejoined, "to remain in the dark. I had
      intended, out of my regard for Emily, to suggest that you might&mdash;with
      advantage to yourself, and to interests that are very dear to you&mdash;be
      more careful in your behavior to Mr. Mirabel. Are you disposed to listen
      to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish me to answer that question plainly, Miss de Sor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I insist on your answering it plainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am <i>not</i> disposed to listen to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I know why? or am I to be left in the dark again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to be left, if you please, to your own ingenuity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine looked at him, with a malignant smile. "One of these days, Mr.
      Morris&mdash;I will deserve your confidence in my ingenuity." She said it,
      and went back to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the only element of disturbance that troubled the perfect
      tranquillity of the day. What Francine had proposed to do, with the one
      idea of making Alban serve her purpose, was accomplished a few hours later
      by Emily's influence for good over the man who loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the afternoon together uninterruptedly in the distant
      solitudes of the park. In the course of conversation Emily found an
      opportunity of discreetly alluding to Mirabel. "You mustn't be jealous of
      our clever little friend," she said; "I like him, and admire him; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't love him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at the eager way in which Alban put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no fear of that," she answered brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even if you discovered that he loves you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even then. Are you content at last? Promise me not to be rude to Mr.
      Mirabel again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For his sake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;for my sake. I don't like to see you place yourself at a
      disadvantage toward another man; I don't like you to disappoint me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiness of hearing her say those words transfigured him&mdash;the
      manly beauty of his earlier and happier years seemed to have returned to
      Alban. He took her hand&mdash;he was too agitated to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are forgetting Mr. Mirabel," she reminded him gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will be all that is civil and kind to Mr. Mirabel; I will like him and
      admire him as you do. Oh, Emily, are you a little, only a very little,
      fond of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I try to find out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fair cheek was very near to him. The softly-rising color on it said,
      Answer me here&mdash;and he answered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. MISCHIEF&mdash;MAKING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Monday, Mirabel made his appearance&mdash;and the demon of discord
      returned with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban had employed the earlier part of the day in making a sketch in the
      park&mdash;intended as a little present for Emily. Presenting himself in
      the drawing-room, when his work was completed, he found Cecilia and
      Francine alone. He asked where Emily was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question had been addressed to Cecilia. Francine answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily mustn't be disturbed," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is with Mr. Mirabel in the rose garden. I saw them talking together&mdash;evidently
      feeling the deepest interest in what they were saying to each other. Don't
      interrupt them&mdash;you will only be in the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia at once protested against this last assertion. "She is trying to
      make mischief, Mr. Morris&mdash;don't believe her. I am sure they will be
      glad to see you, if you join them in the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine rose, and left the room. She turned, and looked at Alban as she
      opened the door. "Try it," she said&mdash;"and you will find I am right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Francine sometimes talks in a very ill-natured way," Cecilia gently
      remarked. "Do you think she means it, Mr. Morris?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had better not offer an opinion," Alban replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't speak impartially; I dislike Miss de Sor."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Alban's sense of self-respect forbade him to try the
      experiment which Francine had maliciously suggested. His thoughts&mdash;less
      easy to restrain&mdash;wandered in the direction of the garden. The
      attempt to make him jealous had failed; but he was conscious, at the same
      time, that Emily had disappointed him. After what they had said to each
      other in the park, she ought to have remembered that women are at the
      mercy of appearances. If Mirabel had something of importance to say to
      her, she might have avoided exposing herself to Francine's spiteful
      misconstruction: it would have been easy to arrange with Cecilia that a
      third person should be present at the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was absorbed in these reflections, Cecilia&mdash;embarrassed by
      the silence&mdash;was trying to find a topic of conversation. Alban
      roughly pushed his sketch-book away from him, on the table. Was he
      displeased with Emily? The same question had occurred to Cecilia at the
      time of the correspondence, on the subject of Miss Jethro. To recall those
      letters led her, by natural sequence, to another effort of memory. She was
      reminded of the person who had been the cause of the correspondence: her
      interest was revived in the mystery of Miss Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Emily told you that I have seen your letter?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself with a start. "I beg your pardon. What letter are you
      thinking of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of the letter which mentions Miss Jethro's strange visit.
      Emily was so puzzled and so surprised that she showed it to me&mdash;and
      we both consulted my father. Have you spoken to Emily about Miss Jethro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have tried&mdash;but she seemed to be unwilling to pursue the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you made any discoveries since you wrote to Emily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. The mystery is as impenetrable as ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he replied in those terms, Mirabel entered the conservatory from the
      garden, evidently on his way to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the man, whose introduction to Emily it had been Miss Jethro's
      mysterious object to prevent&mdash;at the very moment when he had been
      speaking of Miss Jethro herself&mdash;was, not only a temptation of
      curiosity, but a direct incentive (in Emily's own interests) to make an
      effort at discovery. Alban pursued the conversation with Cecilia, in a
      tone which was loud enough to be heard in the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one chance of getting any information that I can see," he proceeded,
      "is to speak to Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be only too glad, if I can be of any service to Miss Wyvil and
      Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those obliging words, Mirabel made a dramatic entry, and looked at
      Cecilia with his irresistible smile. Startled by his sudden appearance,
      she unconsciously assisted Alban's design. Her silence gave him the
      opportunity of speaking in her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were talking," he said quietly to Mirabel, "of a lady with whom you
      are acquainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! May I ask the lady's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel sustained the shock with extraordinary self-possession&mdash;so
      far as any betrayal by sudden movement was concerned. But his color told
      the truth: it faded to paleness&mdash;it revealed, even to Cecilia's eyes,
      a man overpowered by fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban offered him a chair. He refused to take it by a gesture. Alban tried
      an apology next. "I am afraid I have ignorantly revived some painful
      associations. Pray excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The apology roused Mirabel: he felt the necessity of offering some
      explanation. In timid animals, the one defensive capacity which is always
      ready for action is cunning. Mirabel was too wily to dispute the inference&mdash;the
      inevitable inference&mdash;which any one must have drawn, after seeing the
      effect on him that the name of Miss Jethro had produced. He admitted that
      "painful associations" had been revived, and deplored the "nervous
      sensibility" which had permitted it to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No blame can possibly attach to <i>you</i>, my dear sir," he continued,
      in his most amiable manner. "Will it be indiscreet, on my part, if I ask
      how you first became acquainted with Miss Jethro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I first became acquainted with her at Miss Ladd's school," Alban
      answered. "She was, for a short time only, one of the teachers; and she
      left her situation rather suddenly." He paused&mdash;but Mirabel made no
      remark. "After an interval of a few months," he resumed, "I saw Miss
      Jethro again. She called on me at my lodgings, near Netherwoods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely to renew your former acquaintance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel made that inquiry with an eager anxiety for the reply which he was
      quite unable to conceal. Had he any reason to dread what Miss Jethro might
      have it in her power to say of him to another person? Alban was in no way
      pledged to secrecy, and he was determined to leave no means untried of
      throwing light on Miss Jethro's mysterious warning. He repeated the plain
      narrative of the interview, which he had communicated by letter to Emily.
      Mirabel listened without making any remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After what I have told you, can you give me no explanation?" Alban asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite unable, Mr. Morris, to help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he lying? or speaking, the truth? The impression produced on Alban was
      that he had spoken the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women are never so ready as men to resign themselves to the disappointment
      of their hopes. Cecilia, silently listening up to this time, now ventured
      to speak&mdash;animated by her sisterly interest in Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not tell us," she said to Mirabel, "why Miss Jethro tried to
      prevent Emily Brown from meeting you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know no more of her motive than you do," Mirabel replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban interposed. "Miss Jethro left me," he said, "with the intention&mdash;quite
      openly expressed&mdash;of trying to prevent you from accepting Mr. Wyvil's
      invitation. Did she make the attempt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel admitted that she had made the attempt. "But," he added, "without
      mentioning Miss Emily's name. I was asked to postpone my visit, as a favor
      to herself, because she had her own reasons for wishing it. I had <i>my</i>
      reasons" (he bowed with gallantry to Cecilia) "for being eager to have the
      honor of knowing Mr. Wyvil and his daughter; and I refused."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, the doubt arose: was he lying? or speaking the truth? And, once
      more, Alban could not resist the conclusion that he was speaking the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one thing I should like to know," Mirabel continued, after some
      hesitation. "Has Miss Emily been informed of this strange affair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel seemed to be disposed to continue his inquiries&mdash;and suddenly
      changed his mind. Was he beginning to doubt if Alban had spoken without
      concealment, in describing Miss Jethro's visit? Was he still afraid of
      what Miss Jethro might have said of him? In any case, he changed the
      subject, and made an excuse for leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am forgetting my errand," he said to Alban. "Miss Emily was anxious to
      know if you had finished your sketch. I must tell her that you have
      returned."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban rose to follow him&mdash;and checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he thought, "I trust Emily!" He sat down again by Cecilia's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel had indeed returned to the rose garden. He found Emily employed as
      he had left her, in making a crown of roses, to be worn by Cecilia in the
      evening. But, in one other respect, there was a change. Francine was
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me for sending you on a needless errand," Emily said to Mirabel;
      "Miss de Sor tells me Mr. Morris has finished his sketch. She left him in
      the drawing-room&mdash;why didn't you bring him here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was talking with Miss Wyvil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel answered absently&mdash;with his eyes on Francine. He gave her one
      of those significant looks, which says to a third person, "Why are you
      here?" Francine's jealousy declined to understand him. He tried a broader
      hint, in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to walk in the garden?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine was impenetrable. "No," she answered, "I am going to stay here
      with Emily."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel had no choice but to yield. Imperative anxieties forced him to
      say, in Francine's presence, what he had hoped to say to Emily privately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I joined Miss Wyvil and Mr. Morris," he began, "what do you think
      they were doing? They were talking of&mdash;Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily dropped the rose-crown on her lap. It was easy to see that she had
      been disagreeably surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Morris has told me the curious story of Miss Jethro's visit," Mirabel
      continued; "but I am in some doubt whether he has spoken to me without
      reserve. Perhaps he expressed himself more freely when he spoke to <i>you</i>.
      Miss Jethro may have said something to him which tended to lower me in
      your estimation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not, Mr. Mirabel&mdash;so far as I know. If I had heard
      anything of the kind, I should have thought it my duty to tell you. Will
      it relieve your anxiety, if I go at once to Mr. Morris, and ask him
      plainly whether he has concealed anything from you or from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel gratefully kissed her hand. "Your kindness overpowers me," he said&mdash;speaking,
      for once, with true emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily immediately returned to the house. As soon as she was out of sight,
      Francine approached Mirabel, trembling with suppressed rage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. PRETENDING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss de Sor began cautiously with an apology. "Excuse me, Mr. Mirabel, for
      reminding you of my presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mirabel made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg to say," Francine proceeded, "that I didn't intentionally see you
      kiss Emily's hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel stood, looking at the roses which Emily had left on her chair, as
      completely absorbed in his own thoughts as if he had been alone in the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I not even worth notice?" Francine asked. "Ah, I know to whom I am
      indebted for your neglect!" She took him familiarly by the arm, and burst
      into a harsh laugh. "Tell me now, in confidence&mdash;do you think Emily
      is fond of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression left by Emily's kindness was still fresh in Mirabel's
      memory: he was in no humor to submit to the jealous resentment of a woman
      whom he regarded with perfect indifference. Through the varnish of
      politeness which overlaid his manner, there rose to the surface the
      underlying insolence, hidden, on all ordinary occasions, from all human
      eyes. He answered Francine&mdash;mercilessly answered her&mdash;at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the dearest hope of my life that she may be fond of me," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine dropped his arm "And fortune favors your hopes," she added, with
      an ironical assumption of interest in Mirabel's prospects. "When Mr.
      Morris leaves us to-morrow, he removes the only obstacle you have to fear.
      Am I right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; you are wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way, if you please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this way. I don't regard Mr. Morris as an obstacle. Emily is too
      delicate and too kind to hurt his feelings&mdash;she is not in love with
      him. There is no absorbing interest in her mind to divert her thoughts
      from me. She is idle and happy; she thoroughly enjoys her visit to this
      house, and I am associated with her enjoyment. There is my chance&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly stopped. Listening to him thus far, unnaturally calm and cold,
      Francine now showed that she felt the lash of his contempt. A hideous
      smile passed slowly over her white face. It threatened the vengeance which
      knows no fear, no pity, no remorse&mdash;the vengeance of a jealous woman.
      Hysterical anger, furious language, Mirabel was prepared for. The smile
      frightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she said scornfully, "why don't you go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A bolder man might still have maintained the audacious position which he
      had assumed. Mirabel's faint heart shrank from it. He was eager to shelter
      himself under the first excuse that he could find. His ingenuity,
      paralyzed by his fears, was unable to invent anything new. He feebly
      availed himself of the commonplace trick of evasion which he had read of
      in novels, and seen in action on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," he asked, with an overacted assumption of surprise,
      "that you think I am in earnest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of any other person, Francine would have instantly seen
      through that flimsy pretense. But the love which accepts the meanest
      crumbs of comfort that can be thrown to it&mdash;which fawns and grovels
      and deliberately deceives itself, in its own intensely selfish interests&mdash;was
      the love that burned in Francine's breast. The wretched girl believed
      Mirabel with such an ecstatic sense of belief that she trembled in every
      limb, and dropped into the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> was in earnest," she said faintly. "Didn't you see it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly shameless; he denied that he had seen it, in the most
      positive manner. "Upon my honor, I thought you were mystifying me, and I
      humored the joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, and looking at him with an expression of tender reproach. "I
      wonder whether I can believe you," she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed you may believe me!" he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated&mdash;for the pleasure of hesitating. "I don't know. Emily
      is very much admired by some men. Why not by you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the best of reasons," he answered "She is poor, and I am poor. Those
      are facts which speak for themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;but Emily is bent on attracting you. She would marry you
      to-morrow, if you asked her. Don't attempt to deny it! Besides, you kissed
      her hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss de Sor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call me 'Miss de Sor'! Call me Francine. I want to know why you
      kissed her hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      He humored her with inexhaustible servility. "Allow me to kiss <i>your</i>
      hand, Francine!&mdash;and let me explain that kissing a lady's hand is
      only a form of thanking her for her kindness. You must own that Emily&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him for the third time. "Emily?" she repeated. "Are you as
      familiar as that already? Does she call you 'Miles,' when you are by
      yourselves? Is there any effort at fascination which this charming
      creature has left untried? She told you no doubt what a lonely life she
      leads in her poor little home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Mirabel felt that he must not permit this to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has said nothing to me about herself," he answered. "What I know of
      her, I know from Mr. Wyvil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed! You asked Mr. Wyvil about her family, of course? What did he
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said she lost her mother when she was a child&mdash;and he told me her
      father had died suddenly, a few years since, of heart complaint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and what else?&mdash;Never mind now! Here is somebody coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      The person was only one of the servants. Mirabel felt grateful to the man
      for interrupting them. Animated by sentiments of a precisely opposite
      nature, Francine spoke to him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A message, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Miss Brown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, miss." He turned to Mirabel. "Miss Brown wishes to speak to you, sir,
      if you are not engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine controlled herself until the man was out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, this is too shameless!" she declared indignantly. "Emily
      can't leave you with me for five minutes, without wanting to see you
      again. If you go to her after all that you have said to me," she cried,
      threatening Mirabel with her outstretched hand, "you are the meanest of
      men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He <i>was</i> the meanest of men&mdash;he carried out his cowardly
      submission to the last extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only say what you wish me to do," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Francine expected some little resistance from a creature bearing the
      outward appearance of a man. "Oh, do you really mean it?" she asked "I
      want you to disappoint Emily. Will you stay here, and let me make your
      excuses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do anything to please you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine gave him a farewell look. Her admiration made a desperate effort
      to express itself appropriately in words. "You are not a man," she said,
      "you are an angel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by himself, Mirabel sat down to rest. He reviewed his own conduct
      with perfect complacency. "Not one man in a hundred could have managed
      that she-devil as I have done," he thought. "How shall I explain matters
      to Emily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering this question, he looked by chance at the unfinished crown of
      roses. "The very thing to help me!" he said&mdash;and took out his
      pocketbook, and wrote these lines on a blank page: "I have had a scene of
      jealousy with Miss de Sor, which is beyond all description. To spare <i>you</i>
      a similar infliction, I have done violence to my own feelings. Instead of
      instantly obeying the message which you have so kindly sent to me, I
      remain here for a little while&mdash;entirely for your sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having torn out the page, and twisted it up among the roses, so that only
      a corner of the paper appeared in view, Mirabel called to a lad who was at
      work in the garden, and gave him his directions, accompanied by a
      shilling. "Take those flowers to the servants' hall, and tell one of the
      maids to put them in Miss Brown's room. Stop! Which is the way to the
      fruit garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad gave the necessary directions. Mirabel walked away slowly, with
      his hands in his pockets. His nerves had been shaken; he thought a little
      fruit might refresh him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII. DEBATING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile Emily had been true to her promise to relieve Mirabel's
      anxieties, on the subject of Miss Jethro. Entering the drawing-room in
      search of Alban, she found him talking with Cecilia, and heard her own
      name mentioned as she opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here she is at last!" Cecilia exclaimed. "What in the world has kept you
      all this time in the rose garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Mr. Mirabel been more interesting than usual?" Alban asked gayly.
      Whatever sense of annoyance he might have felt in Emily's absence, was
      forgotten the moment she appeared; all traces of trouble in his face
      vanished when they looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall judge for yourself," Emily replied with a smile. "Mr. Mirabel
      has been speaking to me of a relative who is very dear to him&mdash;his
      sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was surprised. "Why has he never spoken to <i>us</i> of his
      sister?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a sad subject to speak of, my dear. His sister lives a life of
      suffering&mdash;she has been for years a prisoner in her room. He writes
      to her constantly. His letters from Monksmoor have interested her, poor
      soul. It seems he said something about me&mdash;and she has sent a kind
      message, inviting me to visit her one of these days. Do you understand it
      now, Cecilia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do! Tell me&mdash;is Mr. Mirabel's sister older or younger
      than he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Older."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a widow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she live with her brother?" Alban asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! She has her own house&mdash;far away in Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she near Sir Jervis Redwood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy not. Her house is on the coast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any children?" Cecilia inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; she is quite alone. Now, Cecilia, I have told you all I know&mdash;and
      I have something to say to Mr. Morris. No, you needn't leave us; it's a
      subject in which you are interested. A subject," she repeated, turning to
      Alban, "which you may have noticed is not very agreeable to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jethro?" Alban guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia's curiosity instantly asserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>We</i> have tried to get Mr. Mirabel to enlighten us, and tried in
      vain," she said. "You are a favorite. Have you succeeded?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have made no attempt to succeed," Emily replied. "My only object is to
      relieve Mr. Mirabel's anxiety, if I can&mdash;with your help, Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way can I help you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't be angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I look angry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look serious. It is a very simple thing. Mr. Mirabel is afraid that
      Miss Jethro may have said something disagreeable about him, which you
      might hesitate to repeat. Is he making himself uneasy without any reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without the slightest reason. I have concealed nothing from Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for the explanation." She turned to Cecilia. "May I send one of
      the servants with a message? I may as well put an end to Mr. Mirabel's
      suspense."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was summoned, and was dispatched with the message. Emily would
      have done well, after this, if she had abstained from speaking further of
      Miss Jethro. But Mirabel's doubts had, unhappily, inspired a similar
      feeling of uncertainty in her own mind. She was now disposed to attribute
      the tone of mystery in Alban's unlucky letter to some possible concealment
      suggested by regard for herself. "I wonder whether <i>I</i> have any
      reason to feel uneasy?" she said&mdash;half in jest, half in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uneasy about what?" Alban inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About Miss Jethro, of course! Has she said anything of me which your
      kindness has concealed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban seemed to be a little hurt by the doubt which her question implied.
      "Was that your motive," he asked, "for answering my letter as cautiously
      as if you had been writing to a stranger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed you are quite wrong!" Emily earnestly assured him. "I was
      perplexed and startled&mdash;and I took Mr. Wyvil's advice, before I wrote
      to you. Shall we drop the subject?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban would have willingly dropped the subject&mdash;but for that
      unfortunate allusion to Mr. Wyvil. Emily had unconsciously touched him on
      a sore place. He had already heard from Cecilia of the consultation over
      his letter, and had disapproved of it. "I think you were wrong to trouble
      Mr. Wyvil," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The altered tone of his voice suggested to Emily that he would have spoken
      more severely, if Cecilia had not been in the room. She thought him
      needlessly ready to complain of a harmless proceeding&mdash;and she too
      returned to the subject, after having proposed to drop it not a minute
      since!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't tell me I was to keep your letter a secret," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia made matters worse&mdash;with the best intentions. "I'm sure, Mr.
      Morris, my father was only too glad to give Emily his advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban remained silent&mdash;ungraciously silent as Emily thought, after
      Mr. Wyvil's kindness to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing to regret," she remarked, "is that Mr. Morris allowed Miss
      Jethro to leave him without explaining herself. In his place, I should
      have insisted on knowing why she wanted to prevent me from meeting Mr.
      Mirabel in this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia made another unlucky attempt at judicious interference. This time,
      she tried a gentle remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember, Emily, how Mr. Morris was situated. He could hardly be rude to
      a lady. And I daresay Miss Jethro had good reasons for not wishing to
      explain herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine opened the drawing-room door and heard Cecilia's last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jethro again!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Mr. Mirabel?" Emily asked. "I sent him a message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He regrets to say he is otherwise engaged for the present," Francine
      replied with spiteful politeness. "Don't let me interrupt the
      conversation. Who is this Miss Jethro, whose name is on everybody's lips?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban could keep silent no longer. "We have done with the subject," he
      said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I am here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because we have said more than enough about Miss Jethro already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak for yourself, Mr. Morris," Emily answered, resenting the masterful
      tone which Alban's interference had assumed. "I have not done with Miss
      Jethro yet, I can assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you don't know where she lives," Cecilia reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me to discover it!" Emily answered hotly. "Perhaps Mr. Mirabel
      knows. I shall ask Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you would find a reason for returning to Mr. Mirabel," Francine
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Emily could reply, one of the maids entered the room with a wreath
      of roses in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Mirabel sends you these flowers, miss," the woman said, addressing
      Emily. "The boy told me they were to be taken to your room. I thought it
      was a mistake, and I have brought them to you here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine, who happened to be nearest to the door, took the roses from the
      girl on pretense of handing them to Emily. Her jealous vigilance detected
      the one visible morsel of Mirabel's letter, twisted up with the flowers.
      Had Emily entrapped him into a secret correspondence with her? "A scrap of
      waste paper among your roses," she said, crumpling it up in her hand as if
      she meant to throw it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Emily was too quick for her. She caught Francine by the wrist. "Waste
      paper or not," she said; "it was among my flowers and it belongs to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine gave up the letter, with a look which might have startled Emily
      if she had noticed it. She handed the roses to Cecilia. "I was making a
      wreath for you to wear this evening, my dear&mdash;and I left it in the
      garden. It's not quite finished yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was delighted. "How lovely it is!" she exclaimed. "And how very
      kind of you! I'll finish it myself." She turned away to the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had no idea I was interfering with a letter," said Francine; watching
      Emily with fiercely-attentive eyes, while she smoothed out the crumpled
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having read what Mirabel had written to her, Emily looked up, and saw that
      Alban was on the point of following Cecilia into the conservatory. He had
      noticed something in Francine's face which he was at a loss to understand,
      but which made her presence in the room absolutely hateful to him. Emily
      followed and spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going back to the rose garden," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For any particular purpose?" Alban inquired
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a purpose which, I am afraid, you won't approve of. I mean to ask Mr.
      Mirabel if he knows Miss Jethro's address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope he is as ignorant of it as I am," Alban answered gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we going to quarrel over Miss Jethro, as we once quarreled over Mrs.
      Rook?" Emily asked&mdash;with the readiest recovery of her good humor.
      "Come! come! I am sure you are as anxious, in your own private mind, to
      have this matter cleared up as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With one difference&mdash;that I think of consequences, and you don't."
      He said it, in his gentlest and kindest manner, and stepped into the
      conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind the consequences," she called after him, "if we can only get
      at the truth. I hate being deceived!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no person living who has better reason than you have to say
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked round with a start. Alban was out of hearing. It was Francine
      who had answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francine hesitated. A ghastly paleness overspread her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ill?" Emily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I am thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      After waiting for a moment in silence, Emily moved away toward the door of
      the drawing-room. Francine suddenly held up her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mind is made up," Francine said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Made up&mdash;to what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You asked what I meant, just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my mind is made up to answer you. Miss Emily Brown, you are leading
      a sadly frivolous life in this house. I am going to give you something
      more serious to think about than your flirtation with Mr. Mirabel. Oh,
      don't be impatient! I am coming to the point. Without knowing it yourself,
      you have been the victim of deception for years past&mdash;cruel deception&mdash;wicked
      deception that puts on the mask of mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you alluding to Miss Jethro?" Emily asked, in astonishment. "I
      thought you were strangers to each other. Just now, you wanted to know who
      she was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about her. I care nothing about her. I am not thinking of
      Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you thinking of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thinking," Francine answered, "of your dead father."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. INVESTIGATING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having revived his sinking energies in the fruit garden, Mirabel seated
      himself under the shade of a tree, and reflected on the critical position
      in which he was placed by Francine's jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Miss de Sor continued to be Mr. Wyvil's guest, there seemed to be no
      other choice before Mirabel than to leave Monksmoor&mdash;and to trust to
      a favorable reply to his sister's invitation for the free enjoyment of
      Emily's society under another roof. Try as he might, he could arrive at no
      more satisfactory conclusion than this. In his preoccupied state, time
      passed quickly. Nearly an hour had elapsed before he rose to return to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the hall, he was startled by a cry of terror in a woman's voice,
      coming from the upper regions. At the same time Mr. Wyvil, passing along
      the bedroom corridor after leaving the music-room, was confronted by his
      daughter, hurrying out of Emily's bedchamber in such a state of alarm that
      she could hardly speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone!" she cried, the moment she saw her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil took her in his arms and tried to compose her. "Who has gone?"
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily! Oh, papa, Emily has left us! She has heard dreadful news&mdash;she
      told me so herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What news? How did she hear it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how she heard it. I went back to the drawing-room to show
      her my roses&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! She frightened me&mdash;she seemed quite wild. She said, 'Let me be
      by myself; I shall have to go home.' She kissed me&mdash;and ran up to her
      room. Oh, I am such a fool! Anybody else would have taken care not to lose
      sight of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long did you leave her by herself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say. I thought I would go and tell you. And then I got anxious
      about her, and knocked at her door, and looked into the room. Gone! Gone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil rang the bell and confided Cecilia to the care of her maid.
      Mirabel had already joined him in the corridor. They went downstairs
      together and consulted with Alban. He volunteered to make immediate
      inquiries at the railway station. Mr. Wyvil followed him, as far as the
      lodge gate which opened on the highroad&mdash;while Mirabel went to a
      second gate, at the opposite extremity of the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil obtained the first news of Emily. The lodge keeper had seen her
      pass him, on her way out of the park, in the greatest haste. He had called
      after her, "Anything wrong, miss?" and had received no reply. Asked what
      time had elapsed since this had happened, he was too confused to be able
      to answer with any certainty. He knew that she had taken the road which
      led to the station&mdash;and he knew no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyvil and Mirabel met again at the house, and instituted an
      examination of the servants. No further discoveries were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question which occurred to everybody was suggested by the words which
      Cecilia had repeated to her father. Emily had said she had "heard dreadful
      news"&mdash;how had that news reached her? The one postal delivery at
      Monksmoor was in the morning. Had any special messenger arrived, with a
      letter for Emily? The servants were absolutely certain that no such person
      had entered the house. The one remaining conclusion suggested that
      somebody must have communicated the evil tidings by word of mouth. But
      here again no evidence was to be obtained. No visitor had called during
      the day, and no new guests had arrived. Investigation was completely
      baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban returned from the railway, with news of the fugitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the station, some time after the departure of the London
      train. The clerk at the office recognized his description of Emily, and
      stated that she had taken her ticket for London. The station-master had
      opened the carriage door for her, and had noticed that the young lady
      appeared to be very much agitated. This information obtained, Alban had
      dispatched a telegram to Emily&mdash;in Cecilia's name: "Pray send us a
      few words to relieve our anxiety, and let us know if we can be of any
      service to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was plainly all that could be done&mdash;but Cecilia was not
      satisfied. If her father had permitted it, she would have followed Emily.
      Alban comforted her. He apologized to Mr. Wyvil for shortening his visit,
      and announced his intention of traveling to London by the next train. "We
      may renew our inquiries to some advantage," he added, after hearing what
      had happened in his absence, "if we can find out who was the last person
      who saw her, and spoke to her, before your daughter found her alone in the
      drawing-room. When I went out of the room, I left her with Miss de Sor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid who waited on Miss de Sor was sent for. Francine had been out, by
      herself, walking in the park. She was then in her room, changing her
      dress. On hearing of Emily's sudden departure, she had been (as the maid
      reported) "much shocked and quite at a loss to understand what it meant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joining her friends a few minutes later, Francine presented, so far as
      personal appearance went, a strong contrast to the pale and anxious faces
      round her. She looked wonderfully well, after her walk. In other respects,
      she was in perfect harmony with the prevalent feeling. She expressed
      herself with the utmost propriety; her sympathy moved poor Cecilia to
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure, Miss de Sor, you will try to help us?" Mr. Wyvil began
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the greatest pleasure," Francine answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long were you and Miss Emily Brown together, after Mr. Morris left
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not more than a quarter of an hour, I should think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did anything remarkable occur in the course of conversation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban interfered for the first time. "Did you say anything," he asked,
      "which agitated or offended Miss Brown?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's rather an extraordinary question," Francine remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you no other answer to give?" Alban inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I answer&mdash;No!" she said, with a sudden outburst of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, the matter dropped. While she spoke in reply to Mr. Wyvil, Francine
      had confronted him without embarrassment. When Alban interposed, she never
      looked at him&mdash;except when he provoked her to anger. Did she remember
      that the man who was questioning her, was also the man who had suspected
      her of writing the anonymous letter? Alban was on his guard against
      himself, knowing how he disliked her. But the conviction in his own mind
      was not to be resisted. In some unimaginable way, Francine was associated
      with Emily's flight from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to the telegram sent from the railway station had not arrived,
      when Alban took his departure for London. Cecilia's suspense began to grow
      unendurable: she looked to Mirabel for comfort, and found none. His office
      was to console, and his capacity for performing that office was notorious
      among his admirers; but he failed to present himself to advantage, when
      Mr. Wyvil's lovely daughter had need of his services. He was, in truth,
      too sincerely anxious and distressed to be capable of commanding his
      customary resources of ready-made sentiment and fluently-pious philosophy.
      Emily's influence had awakened the only earnest and true feeling which had
      ever ennobled the popular preacher's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening, the long-expected telegram was received at last. What
      could be said, under the circumstances, it said in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Safe at home&mdash;don't be uneasy about me&mdash;will write soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that promise they were, for the time, forced to be content.

      CHAPTER XLIX. EMILY SUFFERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother&mdash;left in charge of Emily's place of abode, and feeling
      sensible of her lonely position from time to time&mdash;had just thought
      of trying the cheering influence of a cup of tea, when she heard a cab
      draw up at the cottage gate. A violent ring at the bell followed. She
      opened the door&mdash;and found Emily on the steps. One look at that dear
      and familiar face was enough for the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God help us," she cried, "what's wrong now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word of reply, Emily led the way into the bedchamber which had
      been the scene of Miss Letitia's death. Mrs. Ellmother hesitated on the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you bring me in here?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you try to keep me out?" Emily answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did I try to keep you out, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I came home from school, to nurse my aunt. Ah, you remember now! Is
      it true&mdash;I ask you here, where your old mistress died&mdash;is it
      true that my aunt deceived me about my father's death? And that you knew
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was dead silence. Mrs. Ellmother trembled horribly&mdash;her lips
      dropped apart&mdash;her eyes wandered round the room with a stare of
      idiotic terror. "Is it her ghost tells you that?" she whispered. "Where is
      her ghost? The room whirls round and round, miss&mdash;and the air sings
      in my ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily sprang forward to support her. She staggered to a chair, and lifted
      her great bony hands in wild entreaty. "Don't frighten me," she said.
      "Stand back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily obeyed her. She dashed the cold sweat off her forehead. "You were
      talking about your father's death just now," she burst out, in desperate
      defiant tones. "Well! we know it and we are sorry for it&mdash;your father
      died suddenly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father died murdered in the inn at Zeeland! All the long way to
      London, I have tried to doubt it. Oh, me, I know it now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering in those words, she looked toward the bed. Harrowing
      remembrances of her aunt's delirious self-betrayal made the room
      unendurable to her. She ran out. The parlor door was open. Entering the
      room, she passed by a portrait of her father, which her aunt had hung on
      the wall over the fireplace. She threw herself on the sofa and burst into
      a passionate fit of crying. "Oh, my father&mdash;my dear, gentle, loving
      father; my first, best, truest friend&mdash;murdered! murdered! Oh, God,
      where was your justice, where was your mercy, when he died that dreadful
      death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand was laid on her shoulder; a voice said to her, "Hush, my child! God
      knows best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked up, and saw that Mrs. Ellmother had followed her. "You poor
      old soul," she said, suddenly remembering; "I frightened you in the other
      room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have got over it, my dear. I am old; and I have lived a hard life. A
      hard life schools a person. I make no complaints." She stopped, and began
      to shudder again. "Will you believe me if I tell you something?" she
      asked. "I warned my self-willed mistress. Standing by your father's
      coffin, I warned her. Hide the truth as you may (I said), a time will come
      when our child will know what you are keeping from her now. One or both of
      us may live to see it. I am the one who has lived; no refuge in the grave
      for me. I want to hear about it&mdash;there's no fear of frightening or
      hurting me now. I want to hear how you found it out. Was it by accident,
      my dear? or did a person tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's mind was far away from Mrs. Ellmother. She rose from the sofa,
      with her hands held fast over her aching heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one duty of my life," she said&mdash;"I am thinking of the one duty
      of my life. Look! I am calm now; I am resigned to my hard lot. Never,
      never again, can the dear memory of my father be what it was! From this
      time, it is the horrid memory of a crime. The crime has gone unpunished;
      the man has escaped others. He shall not escape Me." She paused, and
      looked at Mrs. Ellmother absently. "What did you say just now? You want to
      hear how I know what I know? Naturally! naturally! Sit down here&mdash;sit
      down, my old friend, on the sofa with me&mdash;and take your mind back to
      Netherwoods. Alban Morris&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother recoiled from Emily in dismay. "Don't tell me <i>he</i> had
      anything to do with it! The kindest of men; the best of men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man of all men living who least deserves your good opinion or mine,"
      Emily answered sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" Mrs. Ellmother exclaimed, "<i>you</i> say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it. He&mdash;who won on me to like him&mdash;he was in the
      conspiracy to deceive me; and you know it! He heard me talk of the
      newspaper story of the murder of my father&mdash;I say, he heard me talk
      of it composedly, talk of it carelessly, in the innocent belief that it
      was the murder of a stranger&mdash;and he never opened his lips to prevent
      that horrid profanation! He never even said, speak of something else; I
      won't hear you! No more of him! God forbid I should ever see him again.
      No! Do what I told you. Carry your mind back to Netherwoods. One night you
      let Francine de Sor frighten you. You ran away from her into the garden.
      Keep quiet! At your age, must I set you an example of self-control?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know, Miss Emily, where Francine de Sor is now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is at the house in the country, which I have left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where does she go next, if you please? Back to Miss Ladd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so. What interest have you in knowing where she goes next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't interrupt you, miss. It's true that I ran away into the garden. I
      can guess who followed me. How did she find her way to me and Mr. Morris,
      in the dark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The smell of tobacco guided her&mdash;she knew who smoked&mdash;she had
      seen him talking to you, on that very day&mdash;she followed the scent&mdash;she
      heard what you two said to each other&mdash;and she has repeated it to me.
      Oh, my old friend, the malice of a revengeful girl has enlightened me,
      when you, my nurse&mdash;and he, my lover&mdash;left me in the dark: it
      has told me how my father died!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's said bitterly, miss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it said truly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. It isn't said truly of myself. God knows you would never have been
      kept in the dark, if your aunt had listened to me. I begged and prayed&mdash;I
      went down on my knees to her&mdash;I warned her, as I told you just now.
      Must I tell <i>you</i> what a headstrong woman Miss Letitia was? She
      insisted. She put the choice before me of leaving her at once and forever&mdash;or
      giving in. I wouldn't have given in to any other creature on the face of
      this earth. I am obstinate, as you have often told me. Well, your aunt's
      obstinacy beat mine; I was too fond of her to say No. Besides, if you ask
      me who was to blame in the first place, I tell you it wasn't your aunt;
      she was frightened into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who frightened her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your godfather&mdash;the great London surgeon&mdash;he who was visiting
      in our house at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Richard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Sir Richard. He said he wouldn't answer for the consequences,
      in the delicate state of your health, if we told you the truth. Ah, he had
      it all his own way after that. He went with Miss Letitia to the inquest;
      he won over the coroner and the newspaper men to his will; he kept your
      aunt's name out of the papers; he took charge of the coffin; he hired the
      undertaker and his men, strangers from London; he wrote the certificate&mdash;who
      but he! Everybody was cap in hand to the famous man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, the servants and the neighbors asked questions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hundreds of questions! What did that matter to Sir Richard? They were
      like so many children, in <i>his</i> hands. And, mind you, the luck helped
      him. To begin with, there was the common name. Who was to pick out your
      poor father among the thousands of James Browns? Then, again, the house
      and lands went to the male heir, as they called him&mdash;the man your
      father quarreled with in the bygone time. He brought his own establishment
      with him. Long before you got back from the friends you were staying with&mdash;don't
      you remember it?&mdash;we had cleared out of the house; we were miles and
      miles away; and the old servants were scattered abroad, finding new
      situations wherever they could. How could you suspect us? We had nothing
      to fear in that way; but my conscience pricked me. I made another attempt
      to prevail on Miss Letitia, when you had recovered your health. I said,
      'There's no fear of a relapse now; break it to her gently, but tell her
      the truth.' No! Your aunt was too fond of you. She daunted me with
      dreadful fits of crying, when I tried to persuade her. And that wasn't the
      worst of it. She bade me remember what an excitable man your father was&mdash;she
      reminded me that the misery of your mother's death laid him low with brain
      fever&mdash;she said, 'Emily takes after her father; I have heard you say
      it yourself; she has his constitution, and his sensitive nerves. Don't you
      know how she loved him&mdash;how she talks of him to this day? Who can
      tell (if we are not careful) what dreadful mischief we may do?' That was
      how my mistress worked on me. I got infected with her fears; it was as if
      I had caught an infection of disease. Oh, my dear, blame me if it must be;
      but don't forget how I have suffered for it since! I was driven away from
      my dying mistress, in terror of what she might say, while you were
      watching at her bedside. I have lived in fear of what you might ask me&mdash;and
      have longed to go back to you&mdash;and have not had the courage to do it.
      Look at me now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman tried to take out her handkerchief; her quivering hand
      helplessly entangled itself in her dress. "I can't even dry my eyes," she
      said faintly. "Try to forgive me, miss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily put her arms round the old nurse's neck. "It is <i>you</i>," she
      said sadly, "who must forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while they were silent. Through the window that was open to the
      little garden, came the one sound that could be heard&mdash;the gentle
      trembling of leaves in the evening wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was harshly broken by the bell at the cottage door. They both
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's heart beat fast. "Who can it be?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother rose. "Shall I say you can't see anybody?" she asked,
      before leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily heard the door opened&mdash;heard low voices in the passage. There
      was a momentary interval. Then, Mrs. Ellmother returned. She said nothing.
      Emily spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it a visitor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you said I can't see anybody?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be hard on him, my dear. It's Mr. Alban Morris."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. MISS LADD ADVISES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother sat by the dying embers of the kitchen fire; thinking over
      the events of the day in perplexity and distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had waited at the cottage door for a friendly word with Alban, after
      he had left Emily. The stern despair in his face warned her to let him go
      in silence. She had looked into the parlor next. Pale and cold, Emily lay
      on the sofa&mdash;sunk in helpless depression of body and mind. "Don't
      speak to me," she whispered; "I am quite worn out." It was but too plain
      that the view of Alban's conduct which she had already expressed, was the
      view to which she had adhered at the interview between them. They had
      parted in grief&mdash;-perhaps in anger&mdash;perhaps forever. Mrs.
      Ellmother lifted Emily in compassionate silence, and carried her upstairs,
      and waited by her until she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the still hours of the night, the thoughts of the faithful old servant&mdash;dwelling
      for a while on past and present&mdash;advanced, by slow degrees, to
      consideration of the doubtful future. Measuring, to the best of her
      ability, the responsibility which had fallen on her, she felt that it was
      more than she could bear, or ought to bear, alone. To whom could she look
      for help?
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlefolks at Monksmoor were strangers to her. Doctor Allday was near
      at hand&mdash;but Emily had said, "Don't send for him; he will torment me
      with questions&mdash;and I want to keep my mind quiet, if I can." But one
      person was left, to whose ever-ready kindness Mrs. Ellmother could appeal&mdash;and
      that person was Miss Ladd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been easy to ask the help of the good schoolmistress in
      comforting and advising the favorite pupil whom she loved. But Mrs.
      Ellmother had another object in view: she was determined that the
      cold-blooded cruelty of Emily's treacherous friend should not be allowed
      to triumph with impunity. If an ignorant old woman could do nothing else,
      she could tell the plain truth, and could leave Miss Ladd to decide
      whether such a person as Francine deserved to remain under her care.
    </p>
    <p>
      To feel justified in taking this step was one thing: to put it all clearly
      in writing was another. After vainly making the attempt overnight, Mrs.
      Ellmother tore up her letter, and communicated with Miss Ladd by means of
      a telegraphic message, in the morning. "Miss Emily is in great distress. I
      must not leave her. I have something besides to say to you which cannot be
      put into a letter. Will you please come to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the forenoon, Mrs. Ellmother was called to the door by the
      arrival of a visitor. The personal appearance of the stranger impressed
      her favorably. He was a handsome little gentleman; his manners were
      winning, and his voice was singularly pleasant to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come from Mr. Wyvil's house in the country," he said; "and I bring
      a letter from his daughter. May I take the opportunity of asking if Miss
      Emily is well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it, sir, I am sorry to say. She is so poorly that she keeps her
      bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this reply, the visitor's face revealed such sincere sympathy and
      regret, that Mrs. Ellmother was interested in him: she added a word more.
      "My mistress has had a hard trial to bear, sir. I hope there is no bad
      news for her in the young lady's letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, there is news that she will be glad to hear&mdash;Miss
      Wyvil is coming here this evening. Will you excuse my asking if Miss Emily
      has had medical advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She won't hear of seeing the doctor, sir. He's a good friend of hers&mdash;and
      he lives close by. I am unfortunately alone in the house. If I could leave
      her, I would go at once and ask his advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let <i>me</i> go!" Mirabel eagerly proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother's face brightened. "That's kindly thought of, sir&mdash;if
      you don't mind the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good lady, nothing is a trouble in your young mistress's service. Give
      me the doctor's name and address&mdash;and tell me what to say to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one thing you must be careful of," Mrs. Ellmother answered. "He
      mustn't come here, as if he had been sent for&mdash;she would refuse to
      see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel understood her. "I will not forget to caution him. Kindly tell
      Miss Emily I called&mdash;my name is Mirabel. I will return to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened away on his errand&mdash;only to find that he had arrived too
      late. Doctor Allday had left London; called away to a serious case of
      illness. He was not expected to get back until late in the afternoon.
      Mirabel left a message, saying that he would return in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next visitor who arrived at the cottage was the trusty friend, in
      whose generous nature Mrs. Ellmother had wisely placed confidence. Miss
      Ladd had resolved to answer the telegram in person, the moment she read
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is bad news," she said, "let me hear it at once. I am not well
      enough to bear suspense; my busy life at the school is beginning to tell
      on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing that need alarm you, ma'am&mdash;but there is a great
      deal to say, before you see Miss Emily. My stupid head turns giddy with
      thinking of it. I hardly know where to begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begin with Emily," Miss Ladd suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother took the advice. She described Emily's unexpected arrival
      on the previous day; and she repeated what had passed between them
      afterward. Miss Ladd's first impulse, when she had recovered her
      composure, was to go to Emily without waiting to hear more. Not presuming
      to stop her, Mrs. Ellmother ventured to put a question "Do you happen to
      have my telegram about you, ma'am?" Miss Ladd produced it. "Will you
      please look at the last part of it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd read the words: "I have something besides to say to you which
      cannot be put into a letter." She at once returned to her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does what you have still to tell me refer to any person whom I know?" she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It refers, ma'am, to Miss de Sor. I am afraid I shall distress you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did I say, when I came in?" Miss Ladd asked. "Speak out plainly; and
      try&mdash;it's not easy, I know&mdash;but try to begin at the beginning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother looked back through her memory of past events, and began by
      alluding to the feeling of curiosity which she had excited in Francine, on
      the day when Emily had made them known to one another. From this she
      advanced to the narrative of what had taken place at Netherwoods&mdash;to
      the atrocious attempt to frighten her by means of the image of wax&mdash;to
      the discovery made by Francine in the garden at night&mdash;and to the
      circumstances under which that discovery had been communicated to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd's face reddened with indignation. "Are you sure of all that you
      have said?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite sure, ma'am. I hope I have not done wrong," Mrs. Ellmother
      added simply, "in telling you all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong?" Miss Ladd repeated warmly. "If that wretched girl has no defense
      to offer, she is a disgrace to my school&mdash;and I owe you a debt of
      gratitude for showing her to me in her true character. She shall return at
      once to Netherwoods; and she shall answer me to my entire satisfaction&mdash;or
      leave my house. What cruelty! what duplicity! In all my experience of
      girls, I have never met with the like of it. Let me go to my dear little
      Emily&mdash;and try to forget what I have heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother led the good lady to Emily's room&mdash;and, returning to
      the lower part of the house, went out into the garden. The mental effort
      that she had made had left its result in an aching head, and in an
      overpowering sense of depression. "A mouthful of fresh air will revive
      me," she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front garden and back garden at the cottage communicated with each
      other. Walking slowly round and round, Mrs. Ellmother heard footsteps on
      the road outside, which stopped at the gate. She looked through the
      grating, and discovered Alban Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, sir!" she said, rejoiced to see him. He obeyed in silence. The
      full view of his face shocked Mrs. Ellmother. Never in her experience of
      the friend who had been so kind to her at Netherwoods, had he looked so
      old and so haggard as he looked now. "Oh, Mr. Alban, I see how she has
      distressed you! Don't take her at her word. Keep a good heart, sir&mdash;young
      girls are never long together of the same mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban gave her his hand. "I mustn't speak about it," he said. "Silence
      helps me to bear my misfortune as becomes a man. I have had some hard
      blows in my time: they don't seem to have blunted my sense of feeling as I
      thought they had. Thank God, she doesn't know how she has made me suffer!
      I want to ask her pardon for having forgotten myself yesterday. I spoke
      roughly to her, at one time. No: I won't intrude on her; I have said I am
      sorry, in writing. Do you mind giving it to her? Good-by&mdash;and thank
      you. I mustn't stay longer; Miss Ladd expects me at Netherwoods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Ladd is in the house, sir, at this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, in London!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upstairs, with Miss Emily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upstairs? Is Emily ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is getting better, sir. Would you like to see Miss Ladd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should indeed! I have something to say to her&mdash;and time is of
      importance to me. May I wait in the garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not in the parlor, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The parlor reminds me of happier days. In time, I may have courage enough
      to look at the room again. Not now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she doesn't make it up with that good man," Mrs. Ellmother thought, on
      her way back to the house, "my nurse-child is what I have never believed
      her to be yet&mdash;she's a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour more, Miss Ladd joined Alban on the little plot of grass
      behind the cottage. "I bring Emily's reply to your letter," she said.
      "Read it, before you speak to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban read it: "Don't suppose you have offended me&mdash;and be assured
      that I feel gratefully the tone in which your note is written. I try to
      write forbearingly on my side; I wish I could write acceptably as well. It
      is not to be done. I am as unable as ever to enter into your motives. You
      are not my relation; you were under no obligation of secrecy: you heard me
      speak ignorantly of the murder of my father, as if it had been the murder
      of a stranger; and yet you kept me&mdash;deliberately, cruelly kept me&mdash;deceived!
      The remembrance of it burns me like fire. I cannot&mdash;oh, Alban, I
      cannot restore you to the place in my estimation which you have lost! If
      you wish to help me to bear my trouble, I entreat you not to write to me
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban offered the letter silently to Miss Ladd. She signed to him to keep
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what Emily has written," she said; "and I have told her, what I
      now tell you&mdash;she is wrong; in every way, wrong. It is the misfortune
      of her impetuous nature that she rushes to conclusions&mdash;and those
      conclusions once formed, she holds to them with all the strength of her
      character. In this matter, she has looked at her side of the question
      exclusively; she is blind to your side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not willfully!" Alban interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd looked at him with admiration. "You defend Emily?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love her," Alban answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd felt for him, as Mrs. Ellmother had felt for him. "Trust to
      time, Mr. Morris," she resumed. "The danger to be afraid of is&mdash;the
      danger of some headlong action, on her part, in the interval. Who can say
      what the end may be, if she persists in her present way of thinking? There
      is something monstrous, in a young girl declaring that it is <i>her</i>
      duty to pursue a murderer, and to bring him to justice! Don't you see it
      yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban still defended Emily. "It seems to me to be a natural impulse," he
      said&mdash;"natural, and noble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noble!" Miss Ladd exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;for it grows out of the love which has not died with her
      father's death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you encourage her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With my whole heart&mdash;if she would give me the opportunity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't pursue the subject, Mr. Morris. I am told by Mrs. Ellmother that
      you have something to say to me. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to ask you," Alban replied, "to let me resign my situation at
      Netherwoods."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd was not only surprised; she was also&mdash;a very rare thing
      with her&mdash;inclined to be suspicious. After what he had said to Emily,
      it occurred to her that Alban might be meditating some desperate project,
      with the hope of recovering his lost place in her favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard of some better employment?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard of no employment. My mind is not in a state to give the
      necessary attention to my pupils."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your only reason for wishing to leave me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is one of my reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only one which you think it necessary to mention?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be sorry to lose you, Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, Miss Ladd, I am not ungrateful for your kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you let me, in all kindness, say something more?" Miss Ladd
      answered. "I don't intrude on your secrets&mdash;I only hope that you have
      no rash project in view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you, Miss Ladd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Morris&mdash;you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands with him&mdash;and went back to Emily.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. THE DOCTOR SEES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alban returned to Netherwoods&mdash;to continue his services, until
      another master could be found to take his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a later train Miss Ladd followed him. Emily was too well aware of the
      importance of the mistress's presence to the well-being of the school, to
      permit her to remain at the cottage. It was understood that they were to
      correspond, and that Emily's room was waiting for her at Netherwoods,
      whenever she felt inclined to occupy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother made the tea, that evening, earlier than usual. Being alone
      again with Emily, it struck her that she might take advantage of her
      position to say a word in Alban's favor. She had chosen her time
      unfortunately. The moment she pronounced the name, Emily checked her by a
      look, and spoke of another person&mdash;that person being Miss Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother at once entered her protest, in her own downright way.
      "Whatever you do," she said, "don't go back to that! What does Miss Jethro
      matter to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am more interested in her than you suppose&mdash;I happen to know why
      she left the school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begging your pardon, miss, that's quite impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She left the school," Emily persisted, "for a serious reason. Miss Ladd
      discovered that she had used false references."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord! who told you that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see I know it. I asked Miss Ladd how she got her information. She was
      bound by a promise never to mention the person's name. I didn't say it to
      her&mdash;but I may say it to you. I am afraid I have an idea of who the
      person was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Mrs. Ellmother obstinately asserted, "you can't possibly know who it
      was! How should you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish me to repeat what I heard in that room opposite, when my aunt
      was dying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drop it, Miss Emily! For God's sake, drop it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't drop it. It's dreadful to me to have suspicions of my aunt&mdash;and
      no better reason for them than what she said in a state of delirium. Tell
      me, if you love me, was it her wandering fancy? or was it the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I hope to be saved, Miss Emily, I can only guess as you do&mdash;I
      don't rightly know. My mistress trusted me half way, as it were. I'm
      afraid I have a rough tongue of my own sometimes. I offended her&mdash;and
      from that time she kept her own counsel. What she did, she did in the
      dark, so far as I was concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you offend her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be obliged to speak of your father if I tell you how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>He</i> was not to blame&mdash;mind that!" Mrs. Ellmother said
      earnestly. "If I wasn't certain of what I say now you wouldn't get a word
      out of me. Good harmless man&mdash;there's no denying it&mdash;he <i>was</i>
      in love with Miss Jethro! What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was thinking of her memorable conversation with the disgraced
      teacher on her last night at school. "Nothing" she answered. "Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had not tried to keep it secret from us," Mrs. Ellmother resumed,
      "your aunt might never have taken it into her head that he was entangled
      in a love affair of the shameful sort. I don't deny that I helped her in
      her inquiries; but it was only because I felt sure from the first that the
      more she discovered the more certainly my master's innocence would show
      itself. He used to go away and visit Miss Jethro privately. In the time
      when your aunt trusted me, we never could find out where. She made that
      discovery afterward for herself (I can't tell you how long afterward); and
      she spent money in employing mean wretches to pry into Miss Jethro's past
      life. She had (if you will excuse me for saying it) an old maid's hatred
      of the handsome young woman, who lured your father away from home, and set
      up a secret (in a manner of speaking) between her brother and herself. I
      won't tell you how we looked at letters and other things which he forgot
      to leave under lock and key. I will only say there was one bit, in a
      journal he kept, which made me ashamed of myself. I read it out to Miss
      Letitia; and I told her in so many words, not to count any more on me. No;
      I haven't got a copy of the words&mdash;I can remember them without a
      copy. 'Even if my religion did not forbid me to peril my soul by leading a
      life of sin with this woman whom I love'&mdash;that was how it began&mdash;'the
      thought of my daughter would keep me pure. No conduct of mine shall ever
      make me unworthy of my child's affection and respect.' There! I'm making
      you cry; I won't stay here any longer. All that I had to say has been
      said. Nobody but Miss Ladd knows for certain whether your aunt was
      innocent or guilty in the matter of Miss Jethro's disgrace. Please to
      excuse me; my work's waiting downstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, as she pursued her domestic labors, Mrs. Ellmother
      thought of Mirabel. Hours on hours had passed&mdash;and the doctor had not
      appeared. Was he too busy to spare even a few minutes of his time? Or had
      the handsome little gentleman, after promising so fairly, failed to
      perform his errand? This last doubt wronged Mirabel. He had engaged to
      return to the doctor's house; and he kept his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday was at home again, and was seeing patients. Introduced in
      his turn, Mirabel had no reason to complain of his reception. At the same
      time, after he had stated the object of his visit, something odd began to
      show itself in the doctor's manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Mirabel with an appearance of uneasy curiosity; and he
      contrived an excuse for altering the visitor's position in the room, so
      that the light fell full on Mirabel's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy I must have seen you," the doctor said, "at some former time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ashamed to say I don't remember it," Mirabel answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, very likely I'm wrong! I'll call on Miss Emily, sir, you may depend
      on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Left in his consulting-room, Doctor Allday failed to ring the bell which
      summoned the next patient who was waiting for him. He took his diary from
      the table drawer, and turned to the daily entries for the past month of
      July.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the fifteenth day of the month, he glanced at the first lines
      of writing: "A visit from a mysterious lady, calling herself Miss Jethro.
      Our conference led to some very unexpected results."
    </p>
    <p>
      No: that was not what he was in search of. He looked a little lower down:
      and read on regularly, from that point, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Called on Miss Emily, in great anxiety about the discoveries which she
      might make among her aunt's papers. Papers all destroyed, thank God&mdash;except
      the Handbill, offering a reward for discovery of the murderer, which she
      found in the scrap-book. Gave her back the Handbill. Emily much surprised
      that the wretch should have escaped, with such a careful description of
      him circulated everywhere. She read the description aloud to me, in her
      nice clear voice: 'Supposed age between twenty-five and thirty years. A
      well-made man of small stature. Fai r complexion, delicate features, clear
      blue eyes. Hair light, and cut rather short. Clean shaven, with the
      exception of narrow half-whiskers'&mdash;and so on. Emily at a loss to
      understand how the fugitive could disguise himself. Reminded her that he
      could effectually disguise his head and face (with time to help him) by
      letting his hair grow long, and cultivating his beard. Emily not
      convinced, even by this self-evident view of the case. Changed the
      subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor put away his diary, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curious," he thought. "That dandified little clergyman has certainly
      reminded me of my discussion with Emily, more than two months since. Was
      it his flowing hair, I wonder? or his splendid beard? Good God! suppose it
      should turn out&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by the appearance of his patient. Other ailing people
      followed. Doctor Allday's mind was professionally occupied for the rest of
      the evening.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. "IF I COULD FIND A FRIEND!"
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after Miss Ladd had taken her departure, a parcel arrived for
      Emily, bearing the name of a bookseller printed on the label. It was
      large, and it was heavy. "Reading enough, I should think, to last for a
      lifetime," Mrs. Ellmother remarked, after carrying the parcel upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily called her back as she was leaving the room. "I want to caution
      you," she said, "before Miss Wyvil comes. Don't tell her&mdash;don't tell
      anybody&mdash;how my father met his death. If other persons are taken into
      our confidence, they will talk of it. We don't know how near to us the
      murderer may be. The slightest hint may put him on his guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, miss, are you still thinking of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think of nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad for your mind, Miss Emily&mdash;and bad for your body, as your looks
      show. I wish you would take counsel with some discreet person, before you
      move in this matter by yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily sighed wearily. "In my situation, where is the person whom I can
      trust?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can trust the good doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I? Perhaps I was wrong when I told you I wouldn't see him. He might
      be of some use to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother made the most of this concession, in the fear that Emily
      might change her mind. "Doctor Allday may call on you tomorrow," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that you have sent for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be angry! I did it for the best&mdash;and Mr. Mirabel agreed with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Mirabel! What have you told Mr. Mirabel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, except that you are ill. When he heard that, he proposed to go
      for the doctor. He will be here again to-morrow, to ask for news of your
      health. Will you see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know yet&mdash;I have other things to think of. Bring Miss Wyvil
      up here when she comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to get the spare room ready for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. She is staying with her father at the London house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily made that reply almost with an air of relief. When Cecilia arrived,
      it was only by an effort that she could show grateful appreciation of the
      sympathy of her dearest friend. When the visit came to an end, she felt an
      ungrateful sense of freedom: the restraint was off her mind; she could
      think again of the one terrible subject that had any interest for her now.
      Over love, over friendship, over the natural enjoyment of her young life,
      predominated the blighting resolution which bound her to avenge her
      father's death. Her dearest remembrances of him&mdash;tender remembrances
      once&mdash;now burned in her (to use her own words) like fire. It was no
      ordinary love that had bound parent and child together in the bygone time.
      Emily had grown from infancy to girlhood, owing all the brightness of her
      life&mdash;a life without a mother, without brothers, without sisters&mdash;to
      her father alone. To submit to lose this beloved, this only companion, by
      the cruel stroke of disease was of all trials of resignation the hardest
      to bear. But to be severed from him by the murderous hand of a man, was
      more than Emily's fervent nature could passively endure. Before the garden
      gate had closed on her friend she had returned to her one thought, she was
      breathing again her one aspiration. The books that she had ordered, with
      her own purpose in view&mdash;books that might supply her want of
      experience, and might reveal the perils which beset the course that lay
      before her&mdash;were unpacked and spread out on the table. Hour after
      hour, when the old servant believed that her mistress was in bed, she was
      absorbed over biographies in English and French, which related the
      stratagems by means of which famous policemen had captured the worst
      criminals of their time. From these, she turned to works of fiction, which
      found their chief topic of interest in dwelling on the discovery of hidden
      crime. The night passed, and dawn glimmered through the window&mdash;and
      still she opened book after book with sinking courage&mdash;and still she
      gained nothing but the disheartening conviction of her inability to carry
      out her own plans. Almost every page that she turned over revealed the
      immovable obstacles set in her way by her sex and her age. Could <i>she</i>
      mix with the people, or visit the scenes, familiar to the experience of
      men (in fact and in fiction), who had traced the homicide to his
      hiding-place, and had marked him among his harmless fellow-creatures with
      the brand of Cain? No! A young girl following, or attempting to follow,
      that career, must reckon with insult and outrage&mdash;paying their
      abominable tribute to her youth and her beauty, at every turn. What
      proportion would the men who might respect her bear to the men who might
      make her the object of advances, which it was hardly possible to imagine
      without shuddering. She crept exhausted to her bed, the most helpless,
      hopeless creature on the wide surface of the earth&mdash;a girl
      self-devoted to the task of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Careful to perform his promise to Mirabel, without delay, the doctor
      called on Emily early in the morning&mdash;before the hour at which he
      usually entered his consulting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well? What's the matter with the pretty young mistress?" he asked, in his
      most abrupt manner, when Mrs. Ellmother opened the door. "Is it love? or
      jealousy? or a new dress with a wrinkle in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will hear about it, sir, from Miss Emily herself. I am forbidden to
      say anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you mean to say something&mdash;for all that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't joke, Doctor Allday! The state of things here is a great deal too
      serious for joking. Make up your mind to be surprised&mdash;I say no
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the doctor could ask what this meant, Emily opened the parlor door.
      "Come in!" she said, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday's first greeting was strictly professional. "My dear child,
      I never expected this," he began. "You are looking wretchedly ill." He
      attempted to feel her pulse. She drew her hand away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my mind that's ill," she answered. "Feeling my pulse won't cure me
      of anxiety and distress. I want advice; I want help. Dear old doctor, you
      have always been a good friend to me&mdash;be a better friend than ever
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Promise you will keep secret what I am going to say to you&mdash;and
      listen, pray listen patiently, till I have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday promised, and listened. He had been, in some degree at
      least, prepared for a surprise&mdash;but the disclosure which now burst on
      him was more than his equanimity could sustain. He looked at Emily in
      silent dismay. She had surprised and shocked him, not only by what she
      said, but by what she unconsciously suggested. Was it possible that
      Mirabel's personal appearance had produced on her the same impression
      which was present in his own mind? His first impulse, when he was composed
      enough to speak, urged him to put the question cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you happened to meet with the suspected man," he said, "have you any
      means of identifying him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None whatever, doctor. If you would only think it over&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped her there; convinced of the danger of encouraging her, and
      resolved to act on his conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have enough to occupy me in my profession," he said. "Ask your other
      friend to think it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What other friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Alban Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he pronounced the name, he saw that he had touched on some
      painful association. "Has Mr. Morris refused to help you?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not asked him to help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no choice (with such a man as Doctor Allday) between offending
      him or answering him. Emily adopted the last alternative. On this occasion
      she had no reason to complain of his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your view of Mr. Morris's conduct surprises me," he replied&mdash;"surprises
      me more than I can say," he added; remembering that he too was guilty of
      having kept her in ignorance of the truth, out of regard&mdash;mistaken
      regard, as it now seemed to be&mdash;for her peace of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be good to me, and pass it over if I am wrong," Emily said: "I can't
      dispute with you; I can only tell you what I feel. You have always been so
      kind to me&mdash;may I count on your kindness still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday relapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I at least ask," she went on, "if you know anything of persons&mdash;"
      She paused, discouraged by the cold expression of inquiry in the old man's
      eyes as he looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What persons?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Persons whom I suspect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily named the landlady of the inn at Zeeland: she could now place the
      right interpretation on Mrs. Rook's conduct, when the locket had been put
      into her hand at Netherwoods. Doctor Allday answered shortly and stiffly:
      he had never even seen Mrs. Rook. Emily mentioned Miss Jethro next&mdash;and
      saw at once that she had interested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you suspect Miss Jethro of doing?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect her of knowing more of my father's death than she is willing to
      acknowledge," Emily replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's manner altered for the better. "I agree with you," he said
      frankly. "But I have some knowledge of that lady. I warn you not to waste
      time and trouble in trying to discover the weak side of Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was not my experience of her at school," Emily rejoined. "At the
      same time I don't know what may have happened since those days. I may
      perhaps have lost the place I once held in her regard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Through my aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Through your aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope and trust I am wrong," Emily continued; "but I fear my aunt had
      something to do with Miss Jethro's dismissal from the school&mdash;and in
      that case Miss Jethro may have found it out." Her eyes, resting on the
      doctor, suddenly brightened. "You know something about it!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered a little&mdash;whether he should or should not tell her of
      the letter addressed by Miss Ladd to Miss Letitia, which he had found at
      the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could satisfy you that your fears are well founded," he asked,
      "would the discovery keep you away from Miss Jethro?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be ashamed to speak to her&mdash;even if we met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. I can tell you positively, that your aunt was the person who
      turned Miss Jethro out of the school. When I get home, I will send you a
      letter that proves it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's head sank on her breast. "Why do I only hear of this now?" she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I had no reason for letting you know of it, before to-day. If I
      have done nothing else, I have at least succeeded in keeping you and Miss
      Jethro apart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked at him in alarm. He went on without appearing to notice that
      he had startled her. "I wish to God I could as easily put a stop to the
      mad project which you are contemplating."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mad project?" Emily repeated. "Oh, Doctor Allday. Do you cruelly
      leave me to myself, at the time of all others, when I am most in need of
      your sympathy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That appeal moved him. He spoke more gently; he pitied, while he condemned
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor dear child, I should be cruel indeed, if I encouraged you. You
      are giving yourself up to an enterprise, so shockingly unsuited to a young
      girl like you, that I declare I contemplate it with horror. Think, I
      entreat you, think; and let me hear that you have yielded&mdash;not to my
      poor entreaties&mdash;but to your own better sense!" His voice faltered;
      his eyes moistened. "I shall make a fool of myself," he burst out
      furiously, "if I stay here any longer. Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked to the window, and looked out at the fair morning. No one to
      feel for her&mdash;no one to understand her&mdash;nothing nearer that
      could speak to poor mortality of hope and encouragement than the bright
      heaven, so far away! She turned from the window. "The sun shines on the
      murderer," she thought, "as it shines on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down at the table, and tried to quiet her mind; to think steadily
      to some good purpose. Of the few friends that she possessed, every one had
      declared that she was in the wrong. Had <i>they</i> lost the one loved
      being of all beings on earth, and lost him by the hand of a homicide&mdash;and
      that homicide free? All that was faithful, all that was devoted in the
      girl's nature, held her to her desperate resolution as with a hand of
      iron. If she shrank at that miserable moment, it was not from her design&mdash;it
      was from the sense of her own helplessness. "Oh, if I had been a man!" she
      said to herself. "Oh, if I could find a friend!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. THE FRIEND IS FOUND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother looked into the parlor. "I told you Mr. Mirabel would call
      again," she announced. "Here he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he asked to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He leaves it entirely to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, and a moment only, Emily was undecided. "Show him in," she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel's embarrassment was visible the moment he entered the room. For
      the first time in his life&mdash;in the presence of a woman&mdash;the
      popular preacher was shy. He who had taken hundreds of fair hands with
      sympathetic pressure&mdash;he who had offered fluent consolation, abroad
      and at home, to beauty in distress&mdash;was conscious of a rising color,
      and was absolutely at a loss for words when Emily received him. And yet,
      though he appeared at disadvantage&mdash;and, worse still, though he was
      aware of it himself&mdash;there was nothing contemptible in his look and
      manner. His silence and confusion revealed a change in him which inspired
      respect. Love had developed this spoiled darling of foolish congregations,
      this effeminate pet of drawing-rooms and boudoirs, into the likeness of a
      Man&mdash;and no woman, in Emily's position, could have failed to see that
      it was love which she herself had inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally ill at ease, they both took refuge in the commonplace phrases
      suggested by the occasion. These exhausted there was a pause. Mirabel
      alluded to Cecilia, as a means of continuing the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Miss Wyvil?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was here last night; and I expect to see her again to-day before she
      returns to Monksmoor with her father. Do you go back with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;if <i>you</i> do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remain in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I remain in London, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong feeling that was in him had forced its way to expression at
      last. In happier days&mdash;when she had persistently refused to let him
      speak to her seriously&mdash;she would have been ready with a
      light-hearted reply. She was silent now. Mirabel pleaded with her not to
      misunderstand him, by an honest confession of his motives which presented
      him under a new aspect. The easy plausible man, who had hardly ever seemed
      to be in earnest before&mdash;meant, seriously meant, what he said now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I try to explain myself?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, if you wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, don't suppose me capable," Mirabel said earnestly, "of presuming to
      pay you an idle compliment. I cannot think of you, alone and in trouble,
      without feeling anxiety which can only be relieved in one way&mdash;I must
      be near enough to hear of you, day by day. Not by repeating this visit!
      Unless you wish it, I will not again cross the threshold of your door.
      Mrs. Ellmother will tell me if your mind is more at ease; Mrs. Ellmother
      will tell me if there is any new trial of your fortitude. She needn't even
      mention that I have been speaking to her at the door; and she may be sure,
      and you may be sure, that I shall ask no inquisitive questions. I can feel
      for you in your misfortune, without wishing to know what that misfortune
      is. If I can ever be of the smallest use, think of me as your other
      servant. Say to Mrs. Ellmother, 'I want him'&mdash;and say no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is the woman who could have resisted such devotion as this&mdash;inspired,
      truly inspired, by herself? Emily's eyes softened as she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You little know how your kindness touches me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't speak of my kindness until you have put me to the proof," he
      interposed. "Can a friend (such a friend as I am, I mean) be of any use?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the greatest use if I could feel justified in trying you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I entreat you to try me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mr. Mirabel, you don't know what I am thinking of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may be wrong. My friends all say I <i>am</i> wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care what your friends say; I don't care about any earthly thing
      but your tranquillity. Does your dog ask whether you are right or wrong? I
      am your dog. I think of You, and I think of nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked back through the experience of the last few days. Miss Ladd&mdash;Mrs.
      Ellmother&mdash;Doctor Allday: not one of them had felt for her, not one
      of them had spoken to her, as this man had felt and had spoken. She
      remembered the dreadful sense of solitude and helplessness which had wrung
      her heart, in the interval before Mirabel came in. Her father himself
      could hardly have been kinder to her than this friend of a few weeks only.
      She looked at him through her tears; she could say nothing that was
      eloquent, nothing even that was adequate. "You are very good to me," was
      her only acknowledgment of all that he had offered. How poor it seemed to
      be! and yet how much it meant!
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose&mdash;saying considerately that he would leave her to recover
      herself, and would wait to hear if he was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said; "I must not let you go. In common gratitude I ought to
      decide before you leave me, and I do decide to take you into my
      confidence." She hesitated; her color rose a little. "I know how
      unselfishly you offer me your help," she resumed; "I know you speak to me
      as a brother might speak to a sister&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gently interrupted her. "No," he said; "I can't honestly claim to do
      that. And&mdash;may I venture to remind you?&mdash;you know why."
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. Her eyes rested on him with a momentary expression of
      reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it quite fair," she asked, "in my situation, to say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it have been quite fair," he rejoined, "to allow you to deceive
      yourself? Should I deserve to be taken into your confidence, if I
      encouraged you to trust me, under false pretenses? Not a word more of
      those hopes on which the happiness of my life depends shall pass my lips,
      unless you permit it. In my devotion to your interests, I promise to
      forget myself. My motives may be misinterpreted; my position may be
      misunderstood. Ignorant people may take me for that other happier man, who
      is an object of interest to you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Mr. Mirabel! The person to whom you refer has no such claim on me
      as you suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dare I say how happy I am to hear it? Will you forgive me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will forgive you if you say no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. Completely overcome by the new hope that she had inspired,
      Mirabel was unable to answer her. His sensitive nerves trembled under
      emotion, like the nerves of a woman; his delicate complexion faded away
      slowly into whiteness. Emily was alarmed&mdash;he seemed to be on the
      point of fainting. She ran to the window to open it more widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray don't trouble yourself," he said, "I am easily agitated by any
      sudden sensation&mdash;and I am a little overcome at this moment by my own
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me give you a glass of wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you&mdash;I don't need it indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really feel better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel quite well again&mdash;and eager to hear how I can serve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a long story, Mr. Mirabel&mdash;and a dreadful story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreadful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! Let me tell you first how you can serve me. I am in search of a man
      who has done me the cruelest wrong that one human creature can inflict on
      another. But the chances are all against me&mdash;I am only a woman; and I
      don't know how to take even the first step toward discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will know, when I guide you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reminded her tenderly of what she might expect from him, and was
      rewarded by a grateful look. Seeing nothing, suspecting nothing, they
      advanced together nearer and nearer to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once or twice," Emily continued, "I spoke to you of my poor father, when
      we were at Monksmoor&mdash;and I must speak of him again. You could have
      no interest in inquiring about a stranger&mdash;and you cannot have heard
      how he died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, I heard from Mr. Wyvil how he died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard what I had told Mr. Wyvil," Emily said: "I was wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong!" Mirabel exclaimed, in a tone of courteous surprise. "Was it not a
      sudden death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>was</i> a sudden death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caused by disease of the heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caused by no disease. I have been deceived about my father's death&mdash;and
      I have only discovered it a few days since."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the impending moment of the frightful shock which she was innocently
      about to inflict on him, she stopped&mdash;doubtful whether it would be
      best to relate how the discovery had been made, or to pass at once to the
      result. Mirabel supposed that she had paused to control her agitation. He
      was so immeasurably far away from the faintest suspicion of what was
      coming that he exerted his ingenuity, in the hope of sparing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can anticipate the rest," he said. "Your sad loss has been caused by
      some fatal accident. Let us change the subject; tell me more of that man
      whom I must help you to find. It will only distress you to dwell on your
      father's death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Distress me?" she repeated. "His death maddens me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me! hear me! My father died murdered, at Zeeland&mdash;and the man
      you must help me to find is the wretch who killed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She started to her feet with a cry of terror. Mirabel dropped from his
      chair senseless to the floor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV. THE END OF THE FAINTING FIT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emily recovered her presence of mind. She opened the door, so as to make a
      draught of air in the room, and called for water. Returning to Mirabel,
      she loosened his cravat. Mrs. Ellmother came in, just in time to prevent
      her from committing a common error in the treatment of fainting persons,
      by raising Mirabel's head. The current of air, and the sprinkling of water
      over his face, soon produced their customary effect. "He'll come round,
      directly," Mrs. Ellmother remarked. "Your aunt was sometimes taken with
      these swoons, miss; and I know something about them. He looks a poor weak
      creature, in spite of his big beard. Has anything frightened him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily little knew how correctly that chance guess had hit on the truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can possibly have frightened him," she replied; "I am afraid he
      is in bad health. He turned suddenly pale while we were talking; and I
      thought he was going to be taken ill; he made light of it, and seemed to
      recover. Unfortunately, I was right; it was the threatening of a fainting
      fit&mdash;he dropped on the floor a minute afterward."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sigh fluttered over Mirabel's lips. His eyes opened, looked at Mrs.
      Ellmother in vacant terror, and closed again. Emily whispered to her to
      leave the room. The old woman smiled satirically as she opened the door&mdash;then
      looked back, with a sudden change of humor. To see the kind young mistress
      bending over the feeble little clergyman set her&mdash;by some strange
      association of ideas&mdash;thinking of Alban Morris. "Ah," she muttered to
      herself, on her way out, "I call <i>him</i> a Man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was wine in the sideboard&mdash;the wine which Emily had once
      already offered in vain. Mirabel drank it eagerly, this time. He looked
      round the room, as if he wished to be sure that they were alone. "Have I
      fallen to a low place in your estimation?" he asked, smiling faintly. "I
      am afraid you will think poorly enough of your new ally, after this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only think you should take more care of your health," Emily replied,
      with sincere interest in his recovery. "Let me leave you to rest on the
      sofa."
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused to remain at the cottage&mdash;he asked, with a sudden change
      to fretfulness, if she would let her servant get him a cab. She ventured
      to doubt whether he was quite strong enough yet to go away by himself. He
      reiterated, piteously reiterated, his request. A passing cab was stopped
      directly. Emily accompanied him to the gate. "I know what to do," he said,
      in a hurried absent way. "Rest and a little tonic medicine will soon set
      me right." The clammy coldness of his skin made Emily shudder, as they
      shook hands. "You won't think the worse of me for this?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you imagine such a thing!" she answered warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you see me, if I come to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be anxious to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they parted. Emily returned to the house, pitying him with all her
      heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV. MIRABEL SEES HIS WAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reaching the hotel at which he was accustomed to stay when he was in
      London, Mirabel locked the door of his room. He looked at the houses on
      the opposite side of the street. His mind was in such a state of morbid
      distrust that he lowered the blind over the window. In solitude and
      obscurity, the miserable wretch sat down in a corner, and covered his face
      with his hands, and tried to realize what had happened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing had been said at the fatal interview with Emily, which could have
      given him the slightest warning of what was to come. Her father's name&mdash;absolutely
      unknown to him when he fled from the inn&mdash;had only been communicated
      to the public by the newspaper reports of the adjourned inquest. At the
      time when those reports appeared, he was in hiding, under circumstances
      which prevented him from seeing a newspaper. While the murder was still a
      subject of conversation, he was in France&mdash;far out of the track of
      English travelers&mdash;and he remained on the continent until the summer
      of eighteen hundred and eighty-one. No exercise of discretion, on his
      part, could have extricated him from the terrible position in which he was
      now placed. He stood pledged to Emily to discover the man suspected of the
      murder of her father; and that man was&mdash;himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      What refuge was left open to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      If he took to flight, his sudden disappearance would be a suspicious
      circumstance in itself, and would therefore provoke inquiries which might
      lead to serious results. Supposing that he overlooked the risk thus
      presented, would he be capable of enduring a separation from Emily, which
      might be a separation for life? Even in the first horror of discovering
      his situation, her influence remained unshaken&mdash;the animating spirit
      of the one manly capacity for resistance which raised him above the reach
      of his own fears. The only prospect before him which he felt himself to be
      incapable of contemplating, was the prospect of leaving Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this conclusion, his fears urged him to think of
      providing for his own safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first precaution to adopt was to separate Emily from friends whose
      advice might be hostile to his interests&mdash;perhaps even subversive of
      his security. To effect this design, he had need of an ally whom he could
      trust. That ally was at his disposal, far away in the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time when Francine's jealousy began to interfere with all freedom
      of intercourse between Emily and himself at Monksmoor, he had contemplated
      making arrangements which might enable them to meet at the house of his
      invalid sister, Mrs. Delvin. He had spoken of her, and of the bodily
      affliction which confined her to her room, in terms which had already
      interested Emily. In the present emergency, he decided on returning to the
      subject, and on hastening the meeting between the two women which he had
      first suggested at Mr. Wyvil's country seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      No time was to be lost in carrying out this intention. He wrote to Mrs.
      Delvin by that day's post; confiding to her, in the first place, the
      critical position in which he now found himself. This done, he proceeded
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To your sound judgment, dearest Agatha, it may appear that I am making
      myself needlessly uneasy about the future. Two persons only know that I am
      the man who escaped from the inn at Zeeland. You are one of them, and Miss
      Jethro is the other. On you I can absolutely rely; and, after my
      experience of her, I ought to feel sure of Miss Jethro. I admit this; but
      I cannot get over my distrust of Emily's friends. I fear the cunning old
      doctor; I doubt Mr. Wyvil; I hate Alban Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me a favor, my dear. Invite Emily to be your guest, and so separate
      her from these friends. The old servant who attends on her will be
      included in the invitation, of course. Mrs. Ellmother is, as I believe,
      devoted to the interests of Mr. Alban Morris: she will be well out of the
      way of doing mischief, while we have her safe in your northern solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no fear that Emily will refuse your invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, she is already interested in you. In the second
      place, I shall consider the small proprieties of social life; and, instead
      of traveling with her to your house, I shall follow by a later train. In
      the third place, I am now the chosen adviser in whom she trusts; and what
      I tell her to do, she will do. It pains me, really and truly pains me, to
      be compelled to deceive her&mdash;but the other alternative is to reveal
      myself as the wretch of whom she is in search. Was there ever such a
      situation? And, oh, Agatha, I am so fond of her! If I fail to persuade her
      to be my wife, I don't care what becomes of me. I used to think disgrace,
      and death on the scaffold, the most frightful prospect that a man can
      contemplate. In my present frame of mind, a life without Emily may just as
      well end in that way as in any other. When we are together in your old
      sea-beaten tower, do your best, my dear, to incline the heart of this
      sweet girl toward me. If she remains in London, how do I know that Mr.
      Morris may not recover the place he has lost in her good opinion? The bare
      idea of it turns me cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one more point on which I must touch, before I can finish my
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you last wrote, you told me that Sir Jervis Redwood was not expected
      to live much longer, and that the establishment would be broken up after
      his death. Can you find out for me what will become, under the
      circumstances, of Mr. and Mrs. Rook? So far as I am concerned, I don't
      doubt that the alteration in my personal appearance, which has protected
      me for years past, may be trusted to preserve me from recognition by these
      two people. But it is of the utmost importance, remembering the project to
      which Emily has devoted herself, that she should not meet with Mrs. Rook.
      They have been already in correspondence; and Mrs. Rook has expressed an
      intention (if the opportunity offers itself) of calling at the cottage.
      Another reason, and a pressing reason, for removing Emily from London! We
      can easily keep the Rooks out of <i>your</i> house; but I own I should
      feel more at my ease, if I heard that they had left Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that confession, Mrs. Delvin's brother closed his letter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI. ALBAN SEES HIS WAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the first days of Mirabel's sojourn at his hotel in London, events
      were in progress at Netherwoods, affecting the interests of the man who
      was the especial object of his distrust. Not long after Miss Ladd had
      returned to her school, she heard of an artist who was capable of filling
      the place to be vacated by Alban Morris. It was then the twenty-third of
      the month. In four days more the new master would be ready to enter on his
      duties; and Alban would be at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the twenty-fourth, Alban received a telegram which startled him. The
      person sending the message was Mrs. Ellmother; and the words were: "Meet
      me at your railway station to-day, at two o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the old woman in the waiting-room; and he met with a rough
      reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Minutes are precious, Mr. Morris," she said; "you are two minutes late.
      The next train to London stops here in half an hour&mdash;and I must go
      back by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens, what brings you here? Is Emily&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emily is well enough in health&mdash;if that's what you mean? As to why I
      come here, the reason is that it's a deal easier for me (worse luck!) to
      take this journey than to write a letter. One good turn deserves another.
      I don't forget how kind you were to me, away there at the school&mdash;and
      I can't, and won't, see what's going on at the cottage, behind your back,
      without letting you know of it. Oh, you needn't be alarmed about <i>her!</i>
      I've made an excuse to get away for a few hours&mdash;but I haven't left
      her by herself. Miss Wyvil has come to London again; and Mr. Mirabel
      spends the best part of his time with her. Excuse me for a moment, will
      you? I'm so thirsty after the journey, I can hardly speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      She presented herself at the counter in the waiting-room. "I'll trouble
      you, young woman, for a glass of ale." She returned to Alban in a better
      humor. "It's not bad stuff, that! When I have said my say, I'll have a
      drop more&mdash;just to wash the taste of Mr. Mirabel out of my mouth.
      Wait a bit; I have something to ask you. How much longer are you obliged
      to stop here, teaching the girls to draw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave Netherwoods in three days more," Alban replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right! You may be in time to bring Miss Emily to her senses,
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean&mdash;if you don't stop it&mdash;she will marry the parson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't believe it, Mrs. Ellmother! I won't believe it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it's a comfort to him, poor fellow, to say that! Look here, Mr.
      Morris; this is how it stands. You're in disgrace with Miss Emily&mdash;and
      he profits by it. I was fool enough to take a liking to Mr. Mirabel when I
      first opened the door to him; I know better now. He got on the blind side
      of me; and now he has got on the blind side of <i>her</i>. Shall I tell
      you how? By doing what you would have done if you had had the chance. He's
      helping her&mdash;or pretending to help her, I don't know which&mdash;to
      find the man who murdered poor Mr. Brown. After four years! And when all
      the police in England (with a reward to encourage them) did their best,
      and it came to nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind that!" Alban said impatiently. "I want to know how Mr. Mirabel
      is helping her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's more than I can tell you. You don't suppose they take me into
      their confidence? All I can do is to pick up a word, here and there, when
      fine weather tempts them out into the garden. She tells him to suspect
      Mrs. Rook, and to make inquiries after Miss Jethro. And he has his plans;
      and he writes them down, which is dead against his doing anything useful,
      in my opinion. I don't hold with your scribblers. At the same time I
      wouldn't count too positively, in your place, on his being likely to fail.
      That little Mirabel&mdash;if it wasn't for his beard, I should believe he
      was a woman, and a sickly woman too; he fainted in our house the other day&mdash;that
      little Mirabel is in earnest. Rather than leave Miss Emily from Saturday
      to Monday, he has got a parson out of employment to do his Sunday work for
      him. And, what's more, he has persuaded her (for some reasons of his own)
      to leave London next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she going back to Monksmoor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not she! Mr. Mirabel has got a sister, a widow lady; she's a cripple, or
      something of the sort. Her name is Mrs. Delvin. She lives far away in the
      north country, by the sea; and Miss Emily is going to stay with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure? I've seen the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean the letter of invitation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;I do. Miss Emily herself showed it to me. I'm to go with her&mdash;'in
      attendance on my mistress,' as the lady puts it. This I will say for Mrs.
      Delvin: her handwriting is a credit to the school that taught her; and the
      poor bedridden creature words her invitation so nicely, that I myself
      couldn't have resisted it&mdash;and I'm a hard one, as you know. You don't
      seem to heed me, Mr. Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, I was thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thinking of what&mdash;if I may make so bold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of going back to London with you, instead of waiting till the new master
      comes to take my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't do that, sir! You would do harm instead of good, if you showed
      yourself at the cottage now. Besides, it would not be fair to Miss Ladd,
      to leave her before the other man takes your girls off your hands. Trust
      me to look after your interests; and don't go near Miss Emily&mdash;don't
      even write to her&mdash;unless you have got something to say about the
      murder, which she will be eager to hear. Make some discovery in that
      direction, Mr. Morris, while the parson is only trying to do it or
      pretending to do it&mdash;and I'll answer for the result. Look at the
      clock! In ten minutes more the train will be here. My memory isn't as good
      as it was; but I do think I have told you all I had to tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the best of good friends!" Alban said warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind about that, sir. If you want to do a friendly thing in return,
      tell me if you know what has become of Miss de Sor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has returned to Netherwoods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha! Miss Ladd is as good as her word. Would you mind writing to tell me
      of it, if Miss de Sor leaves the school again? Good Lord! there she is on
      the platform with bag and baggage. Don't let her see me, Mr. Morris! If
      she comes in here, I shall set the marks of my ten finger-nails on that
      false face of hers, as sure as I am a Christian woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban placed himself at the door, so as to hide Mrs. Ellmother. There
      indeed was Francine, accompanied by one of the teachers at the school. She
      took a seat on the bench outside the booking-office, in a state of sullen
      indifference&mdash;absorbed in herself&mdash;noticing nothing. Urged by
      ungovernable curiosity, Mrs. Ellmother stole on tiptoe to Alban's side to
      look at her. To a person acquainted with the circumstances there could be
      no possible doubt of what had happened. Francine had failed to excuse
      herself, and had been dismissed from Miss Ladd's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would have traveled to the world's end," Mrs. Ellmother said, "to see
      <i>that!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to her place in the waiting-room, perfectly satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The teacher noticed Alban, on leaving the booking-office after taking the
      tickets. "I shall be glad," she said, looking toward Francine, "when I
      have resigned the charge of that young lady to the person who is to
      receive her in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she to be sent back to her parents?" Alban asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't know yet. Miss Ladd will write to St. Domingo by the next mail.
      In the meantime, her father's agent in London&mdash;the same person who
      pays her allowance&mdash;takes care of her until he hears from the West
      Indies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she consent to this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She doesn't seem to care what becomes of her. Miss Ladd has given her
      every opportunity of explaining and excusing herself, and has produced no
      impression. You can see the state she is in. Our good mistress&mdash;always
      hopeful even in the worst cases, as you know&mdash;thinks she is feeling
      ashamed of herself, and is too proud and self-willed to own it. My own
      idea is, that some secret disappointment is weighing on her mind. Perhaps
      I am wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Miss Ladd was wrong; and the teacher was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passion of revenge, being essentially selfish in its nature, is of all
      passions the narrowest in its range of view. In gratifying her jealous
      hatred of Emily, Francine had correctly foreseen consequences, as they
      might affect the other object of her enmity&mdash;Alban Morris. But she
      had failed to perceive the imminent danger of another result, which in a
      calmer frame of mind might not have escaped discovery. In triumphing over
      Emily and Alban, she had been the indirect means of inflicting on herself
      the bitterest of all disappointments&mdash;she had brought Emily and
      Mirabel together. The first forewarning of this catastrophe had reached
      her, on hearing that Mirabel would not return to Monksmoor. Her worst
      fears had been thereafter confirmed by a letter from Cecilia, which had
      followed her to Netherwoods. From that moment, she, who had made others
      wretched, paid the penalty in suffering as keen as any that she had
      inflicted. Completely prostrated; powerless, through ignorance of his
      address in London, to make a last appeal to Mirabel; she was literally, as
      had just been said, careless what became of her. When the train
      approached, she sprang to her feet&mdash;advanced to the edge of the
      platform&mdash;and suddenly drew back, shuddering. The teacher looked in
      terror at Alban. Had the desperate girl meditated throwing herself under
      the wheels of the engine? The thought had been in both their minds; but
      neither of them acknowledged it. Francine stepped quietly into the
      carriage, when the train drew up, and laid her head back in a corner, and
      closed her eyes. Mrs. Ellmother took her place in another compartment, and
      beckoned to Alban to speak to her at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where can I see you, when you go to London?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Doctor Allday's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Tuesday next."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII. APPROACHING THE END.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alban reached London early enough in the afternoon to find the doctor at
      his luncheon. "Too late to see Mrs. Ellmother," he announced. "Sit down
      and have something to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she left any message for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A message, my good friend, that you won't like to hear. She is off with
      her mistress, this morning, on a visit to Mr. Mirabel's sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he go with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he follows by a later train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Mrs. Ellmother mentioned the address?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is, in her own handwriting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban read the address:&mdash;"Mrs. Delvin, The Clink, Belford,
      Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn to the back of that bit of paper," the doctor said. "Mrs. Ellmother
      has written something on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had written these words: "No discoveries made by Mr. Mirabel, up to
      this time. Sir Jervis Redwood is dead. The Rooks are believed to be in
      Scotland; and Miss Emily, if need be, is to help the parson to find them.
      No news of Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you have got your information," Doctor Allday resumed, "let me have a
      look at you. You're not in a rage: that's a good sign to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not the less determined," Alban answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To bring Emily to her senses?" the doctor asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To do what Mirabel has <i>not</i> done&mdash;and then to let her choose
      between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay? ay? Your good opinion of her hasn't altered, though she has treated
      you so badly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good opinion makes allowance for the state of my poor darling's mind,
      after the shock that has fallen on her," Alban answered quietly. "She is
      not <i>my</i> Emily now. She will be <i>my</i> Emily yet. I told her I was
      convinced of it, in the old days at school&mdash;and my conviction is as
      strong as ever. Have you seen her, since I have been away at Netherwoods?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and she is as angry with me as she is with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the same reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no. I heard enough to warn me to hold my tongue. I refused to help
      her&mdash;that's all. You are a man, and you may run risks which no young
      girl ought to encounter. Do you remember when I asked you to drop all
      further inquiries into the murder, for Emily's sake? The circumstances
      have altered since that time. Can I be of any use?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the greatest use, if you can give me Miss Jethro's address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! You mean to begin in that way, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You know that Miss Jethro visited me at Netherwoods?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She showed me your answer to a letter which she had written to you. Have
      you got that letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allday produced it. The address was at a post-office, in a town on
      the south coast. Looking up when he had copied it, Alban saw the doctor's
      eyes fixed on him with an oddly-mingled expression: partly of sympathy,
      partly of hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything to suggest?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will get nothing out of Miss Jethro," the doctor answered, "unless&mdash;"
      there he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless you can frighten her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How am I to do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little reflection, Doctor Allday returned, without any apparent
      reason, to the subject of his last visit to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was one thing she said, in the course of our talk," he continued,
      "which struck me as being sensible: possibly (for we are all more or less
      conceited), because I agreed with her myself. She suspects Miss Jethro of
      knowing more about that damnable murder than Miss Jethro is willing to
      acknowledge. If you want to produce the right effect on her&mdash;" he
      looked hard at Alban and checked himself once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well? what am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her you have an idea of who the murderer is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have no idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But <i>I</i> have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God! what do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mistake me! An impression has been produced on my mind&mdash;that's
      all. Call it a freak or fancy; worth trying perhaps as a bold experiment,
      and worth nothing more. Come a little nearer. My housekeeper is an
      excellent woman, but I have once or twice caught her rather too near to
      that door. I think I'll whisper it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did whisper it. In breathless wonder, Alban heard of the doubt which
      had crossed Doctor Allday's mind, on the evening when Mirabel had called
      at his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look as if you didn't believe it," the doctor remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of Emily. For her sake I hope and trust you are wrong. Ought
      I to go to her at once? I don't know what to do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find out first, my good fellow, whether I am right or wrong. You can do
      it, if you will run the risk with Miss Jethro."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban recovered himself. His old friend's advice was clearly the right
      advice to follow. He examined his railway guide, and then looked at his
      watch. "If I can find Miss Jethro," he answered, "I'll risk it before the
      day is out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor accompanied him to the door. "You will write to me, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without fail. Thank you&mdash;and good-by."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVIII. A COUNCIL OF TWO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in the last century one of the picturesque race of robbers and
      murderers, practicing the vices of humanity on the borderlands watered by
      the river Tweed, built a tower of stone on the coast of Northumberland. He
      lived joyously in the perpetration of atrocities; and he died penitent,
      under the direction of his priest. Since that event, he has figured in
      poems and pictures; and has been greatly admired by modern ladies and
      gentlemen, whom he would have outraged and robbed if he had been lucky
      enough to meet with them in the good old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son succeeded him, and failed to profit by the paternal example: that
      is to say, he made the fatal mistake of fighting for other people instead
      of fighting for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rebellion of Forty-Five, this northern squire sided to serious
      purpose with Prince Charles and the Highlanders. He lost his head; and his
      children lost their inheritance. In the lapse of years, the confiscated
      property fell into the hands of strangers; the last of whom (having a
      taste for the turf) discovered, in course of time, that he was in want of
      money. A retired merchant, named Delvin (originally of French extraction),
      took a liking to the wild situation, and purchased the tower. His wife&mdash;already
      in failing health&mdash;had been ordered by the doctors to live a quiet
      life by the sea. Her husband's death left her a rich and lonely widow; by
      day and night alike, a prisoner in her room; wasted by disease, and having
      but two interests which reconciled her to life&mdash;writing poetry in the
      intervals of pain, and paying the debts of a reverend brother who
      succeeded in the pulpit, and prospered nowhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the later days of its life, the tower had been greatly improved as a
      place of residence. The contrast was remarkable between the dreary gray
      outer walls, and the luxuriously furnished rooms inside, rising by two at
      a time to the lofty eighth story of the building. Among the scattered
      populace of the country round, the tower was still known by the odd name
      given to it in the bygone time&mdash;"The Clink." It had been so called
      (as was supposed) in allusion to the noise made by loose stones, washed
      backward and forward at certain times of the tide, in hollows of the rock
      on which the building stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of her arrival at Mrs. Delvin's retreat, Emily retired at
      an early hour, fatigued by her long journey. Mirabel had an opportunity of
      speaking with his sister privately in her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send me away, Agatha, if I disturb you," he said, "and let me know when I
      can see you in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Miles, have you forgotten that I am never able to sleep in calm
      weather? My lullaby, for years past, has been the moaning of the great
      North Sea, under my window. Listen! There is not a sound outside on this
      peaceful night. It is the right time of the tide, just now&mdash;and yet,
      'the clink' is not to be heard. Is the moon up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel opened the curtains. "The whole sky is one great abyss of black,"
      he answered. "If I was superstitious, I should think that horrid darkness
      a bad omen for the future. Are you suffering, Agatha?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not just now. I suppose I look sadly changed for the worse since you saw
      me last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the feverish brightness of her eyes, she would have looked like a
      corpse. Her wrinkled forehead, her hollow cheeks, her white lips told
      their terrible tale of the suffering of years. The ghastly appearance of
      her face was heightened by the furnishing of the room. This doomed woman,
      dying slowly day by day, delighted in bright colors and sumptuous
      materials. The paper on the walls, the curtains, the carpet presented the
      hues of the rainbow. She lay on a couch covered with purple silk, under
      draperies of green velvet to keep her warm. Rich lace hid h er scanty
      hair, turning prematurely gray; brilliant rings glittered on her bony
      fingers. The room was in a blaze of light from lamps and candles. Even the
      wine at her side that kept her alive had been decanted into a bottle of
      lustrous Venetian glass. "My grave is open," she used to say; "and I want
      all these beautiful things to keep me from looking at it. I should die at
      once, if I was left in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother sat by the couch, thinking "Shall I tell you what is in your
      mind?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel humored the caprice of the moment. "Tell me!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to know what I think of Emily," she answered. "Your letter told
      me you were in love; but I didn't believe your letter. I have always
      doubted whether you were capable of feeling true love&mdash;until I saw
      Emily. The moment she entered the room, I knew that I had never properly
      appreciated my brother. You <i>are</i> in love with her, Miles; and you
      are a better man than I thought you. Does that express my opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel took her wasted hand, and kissed it gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a position I am in!" he said. "To love her as I love her; and, if
      she knew the truth, to be the object of her horror&mdash;to be the man
      whom she would hunt to the scaffold, as an act of duty to the memory of
      her father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have left out the worst part of it," Mrs. Delvin reminded him. "You
      have bound yourself to help her to find the man. Your one hope of
      persuading her to become your wife rests on your success in finding him.
      And you are the man. There is your situation! You can't submit to it. How
      can you escape from it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are trying to frighten me, Agatha."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am trying to encourage you to face your position boldly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am doing my best," Mirabel said, with sullen resignation. "Fortune has
      favored me so far. I have, really and truly, been unable to satisfy Emily
      by discovering Miss Jethro. She has left the place at which I saw her last&mdash;there
      is no trace to be found of her&mdash;and Emily knows it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't forget," Mrs. Delvin replied, "that there is a trace to be found of
      Mrs. Rook, and that Emily expects you to follow it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel shuddered. "I am surrounded by dangers, whichever way I look," he
      said. "Do what I may, it turns out to be wrong. I was wrong, perhaps, when
      I brought Emily here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could easily make an excuse," Mirabel persisted "and take her back to
      London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for all you know to the contrary," his wiser sister replied, "Mrs.
      Rook may go to London; and you may take Emily back in time to receive her
      at the cottage. In every way you are safer in my old tower. And&mdash;don't
      forget&mdash;you have got my money to help you, if you want it. In my
      belief, Miles, you <i>will</i> want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the dearest and best of sisters! What do you recommend me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you would have been obliged to do," Mrs. Delvin answered, "if you
      had remained in London. You must go to Redwood Hall tomorrow, as Emily has
      arranged it. If Mrs. Rook is not there, you must ask for her address in
      Scotland. If nobody knows the address, you must still bestir yourself in
      trying to find it. And, when you do fall in with Mrs. Rook&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, wherever it may be, that you see her privately."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel was alarmed. "Don't keep me in suspense," he burst out. "Tell me
      what you propose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind what I propose, to-night. Before I can tell you what I have in
      my mind, I must know whether Mrs. Rook is in England or Scotland. Bring me
      that information to-morrow, and I shall have something to say to you.
      Hark! The wind is rising, the rain is falling. There is a chance of sleep
      for me&mdash;I shall soon hear the sea. Good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, dearest&mdash;and thank you again, and again!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX. THE ACCIDENT AT BELFORD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in the morning Mirabel set forth for Redwood Hall, in one of the
      vehicles which Mrs. Delvin still kept at "The Clink" for the convenience
      of visitors. He returned soon after noon; having obtained information of
      the whereabout of Mrs. Rook and her husband. When they had last been heard
      of, they were at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. Whether they had, or had not,
      obtained the situation of which they were in search, neither Miss Redwood
      nor any one else at the Hall could tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour more, another horse was harnessed, and Mirabel was on his
      way to the railway station at Belford, to follow Mrs. Rook at Emily's
      urgent request. Before his departure, he had an interview with his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delvin was rich enough to believe implicitly in the power of money.
      Her method of extricating her brother from the serious difficulties that
      beset him, was to make it worth the while of Mr. and Mrs. Rook to leave
      England. Their passage to America would be secretly paid; and they would
      take with them a letter of credit addressed to a banker in New York. If
      Mirabel failed to discover them, after they had sailed, Emily could not
      blame his want of devotion to her interests. He understood this; but he
      remained desponding and irresolute, even with the money in his hands. The
      one person who could rouse his courage and animate his hope, was also the
      one person who must know nothing of what had passed between his sister and
      himself. He had no choice but to leave Emily, without being cheered by her
      bright looks, invigorated by her inspiriting words. Mirabel went away on
      his doubtful errand with a heavy heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Clink" was so far from the nearest post town, that the few letters,
      usually addressed to the tower, were delivered by private arrangement with
      a messenger. The man's punctuality depended on the convenience of his
      superiors employed at the office. Sometimes he arrived early, and
      sometimes he arrived late. On this particular morning he presented
      himself, at half past one o'clock, with a letter for Emily; and when Mrs.
      Ellmother smartly reproved him for the delay, he coolly attributed it to
      the hospitality of friends whom he had met on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, directed to Emily at the cottage, had been forwarded from
      London by the person left in charge. It addressed her as "Honored Miss."
      She turned at once to the end&mdash;and discovered the signature of Mrs.
      Rook!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mr. Mirabel has gone," Emily exclaimed, "just when his presence is of
      the greatest importance to us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrewd Mrs. Ellmother suggested that it might be as well to read the
      letter first&mdash;and then to form an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lasswade, near Edinburgh, Sept. 26th.
    </p>
    <p>
      "HONORED MISS&mdash;I take up my pen to bespeak your kind sympathy for my
      husband and myself; two old people thrown on the world again by the death
      of our excellent master. We are under a month's notice to leave Redwood
      Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hearing of a situation at this place (also that our expenses would be
      paid if we applied personally), we got leave of absence, and made our
      application. The lady and her son are either the stingiest people that
      ever lived&mdash;or they have taken a dislike to me and my husband, and
      they make money a means of getting rid of us easily. Suffice it to say
      that we have refused to accept starvation wages, and that we are still out
      of place. It is just possible that you may have heard of something to suit
      us. So I write at once, knowing that good chances are often lost through
      needless delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We stop at Belford on our way back, to see some friends of my husband,
      and we hope to get to Redwood Hall in good time on the 28th. Would you
      please address me to care of Miss Redwood, in case you know of any good
      situation for which we could apply. Perhaps we may be driven to try our
      luck in London. In this case, will you permit me to have the honor of
      presenting my respects, as I ventured to propose when I wrote to you a
      little time since.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg to remain, Honored Miss,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      "R. ROOK."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily handed the letter to Mrs. Ellmother. "Read it," she said, "and tell
      me what you think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you had better be careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Careful of Mrs. Rook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;and careful of Mrs. Delvin too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was astonished. "Are you really speaking seriously?" she said. "Mrs.
      Delvin is a most interesting person; so patient under her sufferings; so
      kind, so clever; so interested in all that interests <i>me</i>. I shall
      take the letter to her at once, and ask her advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have your own way, miss. I can't tell you why&mdash;but I don't like
      her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delvin's devotion to the interests of her guest took even Emily by
      surprise. After reading Mrs. Rook's letter, she rang the bell on her table
      in a frenzy of impatience. "My brother must be instantly recalled," she
      said. "Telegraph to him in your own name, telling him what has happened.
      He will find the message waiting for him, at the end of his journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom, summoned by the bell, was ordered to saddle the third and last
      horse left in the stables; to take the telegram to Belford, and to wait
      there until the answer arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far is it to Redwood Hall?" Emily asked, when the man had received
      his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten miles," Mrs. Delvin answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I get there to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you can't get there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, Mrs. Delvin, I must get there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon <i>me</i>. My brother represents you in this matter. Leave it to
      my brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone taken by Mirabel's sister was positive, to say the least of it.
      Emily thought of what her faithful old servant had said, and began to
      doubt her own discretion in so readily showing the letter. The mistake&mdash;if
      a mistake it was&mdash;had however been committed; and, wrong or right,
      she was not disposed to occupy the subordinate position which Mrs. Delvin
      had assigned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will look at Mrs. Rook's letter again," Emily replied, "you will
      see that I ought to answer it. She supposes I am in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you propose to tell Mrs. Rook that you are in this house?" Mrs. Delvin
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better consult my brother, before you take any responsibility on
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily kept her temper. "Allow me to remind you," she said, "that Mr.
      Mirabel is not acquainted with Mrs. Rook&mdash;and that I am. If I speak
      to her personally, I can do much to assist the object of our inquiries,
      before he returns. She is not an easy woman to deal with&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore," Mrs. Delvin interposed, "the sort of person who requires
      careful handling by a man like my brother&mdash;a man of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sort of person, as I venture to think," Emily persisted, "whom I
      ought to see with as little loss of time as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delvin waited a while before she replied. In her condition of health,
      anxiety was not easy to bear. Mrs. Rook's letter and Emily's obstinacy had
      seriously irritated her. But, like all persons of ability, she was
      capable, when there was serious occasion for it, of exerting self-control.
      She really liked and admired Emily; and, as the elder woman and the
      hostess, she set an example of forbearance and good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is out of my power to send you to Redwood Hall at once," she resumed.
      "The only one of my three horses now at your disposal is the horse which
      took my brother to the Hall this morning. A distance, there and back, of
      twenty miles. You are not in too great a hurry, I am sure, to allow the
      horse time to rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily made her excuses with perfect grace and sincerity. "I had no idea
      the distance was so great," she confessed. "I will wait, dear Mrs. Delvin,
      as long as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted as good friends as ever&mdash;with a certain reserve,
      nevertheless, on either side. Emily's eager nature was depressed and
      irritated by the prospect of delay. Mrs. Delvin, on the other hand
      (devoted to her brother's interests), thought hopefully of obstacles which
      might present themselves with the lapse of time. The horse might prove to
      be incapable of further exertion for that day. Or the threatening aspect
      of the weather might end in a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hours passed&mdash;and the sky cleared&mdash;and the horse was
      reported to be fit for work again. Fortune was against the lady of the
      tower; she had no choice but to submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delvin had just sent word to Emily that the carriage would be ready
      for her in ten minutes, when the coachman who had driven Mirabel to
      Belford returned. He brought news which agreeably surprised both the
      ladies. Mirabel had reached the station five minutes too late; the
      coachman had left him waiting the arrival of the next train to the North.
      He would now receive the telegraphic message at Belford, and might return
      immediately by taking the groom's horse. Mrs. Delvin left it to Emily to
      decide whether she would proceed by herself to Redwood Hall, or wait for
      Mirabel's return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the changed circumstances, Emily would have acted ungraciously if
      she had persisted in holding to her first intention. She consented to
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea still remained calm. In the stillness of the moorland solitude on
      the western side of "The Clink," the rapid steps of a horse were heard at
      some little distance on the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily ran out, followed by careful Mrs. Ellmother, expecting to meet
      Mirabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was disappointed: it was the groom who had returned. As he pulled up
      at the house, and dismounted, Emily noticed that the man looked excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything wrong?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There has been an accident, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to Mr. Mirabel!''
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, miss. An accident to a poor foolish woman, traveling from
      Lasswade."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked at Mrs. Ellmother. "It can't be Mrs. Rook!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the name, miss! She got out before the train had quite stopped,
      and fell on the platform."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seriously hurt, as I heard. They carried her into a house hard by&mdash;and
      sent for the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was Mr. Mirabel one of the people who helped her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was on the other side of the platform, miss; waiting for the train
      from London. I got to the station and gave him the telegram, just as the
      accident took place. We crossed over to hear more about it. Mr. Mirabel
      was telling me that he would return to 'The Clink' on my horse&mdash;when
      he heard the woman's name mentioned. Upon that, he changed his mind and
      went to the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he let in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor wouldn't hear of it. He was making his examination; and he
      said nobody was to be in the room but her husband and the woman of the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Mirabel waiting to see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, miss. He said he would wait all day, if necessary; and he gave me
      this bit of a note to take to the mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily turned to Mrs. Ellmother. "It's impossible to stay here, not knowing
      whether Mrs. Rook is going to live or die," she said. "I shall go to
      Belford&mdash;and you will go with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom interfered. "I beg your pardon, miss. It was Mr. Mirabel's most
      particular wish that you were not, on any account, to go to Belford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily eyed the note in the man's hand with well-grounded distrust. In all
      probability, Mirabel's object in writing was to instruct his sister to
      prevent her guest from going to Belford. The carriage was waiting at the
      door. With her usual promptness of resolution, Emily decided on taking it
      for granted that she was free to use as she pleased a carriage which had
      been already placed at her disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell your mistress," she said to the groom, "that I am going to Belford
      instead of to Redwood Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute more, she and Mrs. Ellmother were on their way to join Mirabel
      at the station.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LX. OUTSIDE THE ROOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emily found Mirabel in the waiting room at Belford. Her sudden appearance
      might well have amazed him; but his face expressed a more serious emotion
      than surprise&mdash;he looked at her as if she had alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you get my message?" he asked. "I told the groom I wished you to
      wait for my return. I sent a note to my sister, in case he made any
      mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man made no mistake," Emily answered. "I was in too great a hurry to
      be able to speak with Mrs. Delvin. Did you really suppose I could endure
      the suspense of waiting till you came back? Do you think I can be of no
      use&mdash;I who know Mrs. Rook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They won't let you see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? <i>You</i> seem to be waiting to see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am waiting for the return of the rector of Belford. He is at Berwick;
      and he has been sent for at Mrs. Rook's urgent request."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she dying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is in fear of death&mdash;whether rightly or wrongly, I don't know.
      There is some internal injury from the fall. I hope to see her when the
      rector returns. As a brother clergyman, I may with perfect propriety ask
      him to use his influence in my favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to find you so eager about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am always eager in your interests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think me ungrateful," Emily replied gently. "I am no stranger to
      Mrs. Rook; and, if I send in my name, I may be able to see her before the
      clergyman returns."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped. Mirabel suddenly moved so as to place himself between her and
      the door. "I must really beg of you to give up that idea," he said; "you
      don't know what horrid sight you may see&mdash;what dreadful agonies of
      pain this unhappy woman may be suffering."
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner suggested to Emily that he might be acting under some motive
      which he was unwilling to acknowledge. "If you have a reason for wishing
      that I should keep away from Mrs. Rook," she said, "let me hear what it
      is. Surely we trust each other? I have done my best to set the example, at
      any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirabel seemed to be at a loss for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was hesitating, the station-master passed the door. Emily asked
      him to direct her to the house in which Mrs. Rook had been received. He
      led the way to the end of the platform, and pointed to the house. Emily
      and Mrs. Ellmother immediately left the station. Mirabel accompanied them,
      still remonstrating, still raising obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house door was opened by an old man. He looked reproachfully at
      Mirabel. "You have been told already," he said, "that no strangers are to
      see my wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by discovering that the man was Mr. Rook, Emily mentioned her
      name. "Perhaps you may have heard Mrs. Rook speak of me," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard her speak of you oftentimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does the doctor say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thinks she may get over it. She doesn't believe him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you say that I am anxious to see her, if she feels well enough to
      receive me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rook looked at Mrs. Ellmother. "Are there two of you wanting to go
      upstairs?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my old friend and servant," Emily answered. "She will wait for me
      down here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can wait in the parlor; the good people of this house are well known
      to me." He pointed to the parlor door&mdash;and then led the way to the
      first floor. Emily followed him. Mirabel, as obstinate as ever, followed
      Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rook opened a door at the end of the landing; and, turning round to
      speak to Emily, noticed Mirabel standing behind her. Without making any
      remarks, the old man pointed significantly down the stairs. His resolution
      was evidently immovable. Mirabel appealed to Emily to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will see me, if <i>you</i> ask her," he said, "Let me wait here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his voice was instantly followed by a cry from the
      bed-chamber&mdash;a cry of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rook hurried into the room, and closed the door. In less than a
      minute, he opened it again, with doubt and horror plainly visible in his
      face. He stepped up to Mirabel&mdash;eyed him with the closest scrutiny&mdash;and
      drew back again with a look of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's wrong," he said; "you are not the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      This strange proceeding startled Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What man do you mean?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rook took no notice of the question. Still looking at Mirabel, he
      pointed down the stairs once more. With vacant eyes&mdash;moving
      mechanically, like a sleep-walker in his dream&mdash;Mirabel silently
      obeyed. Mr. Rook turned to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you easily frightened?" he said
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you," Emily replied. "Who is going to frighten me? Why
      did you speak to Mr. Mirabel in that strange way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rook looked toward the bedroom door. "Maybe you'll hear why, inside
      there. If I could have my way, you shouldn't see her&mdash;but she's not
      to be reasoned with. A caution, miss. Don't be too ready to believe what
      my wife may say to you. She's had a fright." He opened the door. "In my
      belief," he whispered, "she's off her head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily crossed the threshold. Mr. Rook softly closed the door behind her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXI. INSIDE THE ROOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A decent elderly woman was seated at the bedside. She rose, and spoke to
      Emily with a mingling of sorrow and confusion strikingly expressed on her
      face. "It isn't my fault," she said, "that Mrs. Rook receives you in this
      manner; I am obliged to humor her."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew aside, and showed Mrs. Rook with her head supported by many
      pillows, and her face strangely hidden from view under a veil. Emily
      started back in horror. "Is her face injured?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook answered the question herself. Her voice was low and weak; but
      she still spoke with the same nervous hurry of articulation which had been
      remarked by Alban Morris, on the day when she asked him to direct her to
      Netherwoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly injured," she explained; "but one's appearance is a matter of
      some anxiety even on one's death-bed. I am disfigured by a thoughtless use
      of water, to bring me to when I had my fall&mdash;and I can't get at my
      toilet-things to put myself right again. I don't wish to shock you. Please
      excuse the veil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily remembered the rouge on her cheeks, and the dye on her hair, when
      they had first seen each other at the school. Vanity&mdash;of all human
      frailties the longest-lived&mdash;still held its firmly-rooted place in
      this woman's nature; superior to torment of conscience, unassailable by
      terror of death!
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman of the house waited a moment before she left the room.
      "What shall I say," she asked, "if the clergyman comes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook lifted her hand solemnly "Say," she answered, "that a dying
      sinner is making atonement for sin. Say this young lady is present, by the
      decree of an all-wise Providence. No mortal creature must disturb us." Her
      hand dropped back heavily on the bed. "Are we alone?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are alone," Emily answered. "What made you scream just before I came
      in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I can't allow you to remind me of that," Mrs. Rook protested. "I must
      compose myself. Be quiet. Let me think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering her composure, she also recovered that sense of enjoyment in
      talking of herself, which was one of the marked peculiarities in her
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will excuse me if I exhibit religion," she resumed. "My dear parents
      were exemplary people; I was most carefully brought up. Are you pious? Let
      us hope so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was once more reminded of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bygone time returned to her memory&mdash;the time when she had
      accepted Sir Jervis Redwood's offer of employment, and when Mrs. Rook had
      arrived at the school to be her traveling companion to the North. The
      wretched creature had entirely forgotten her own loose talk, after she had
      drunk Miss Ladd's good wine to the last drop in the bottle. As she was
      boasting now of her piety, so she had boasted then of her lost faith and
      hope, and had mockingly declared her free-thinking opinions to be the
      result of her ill-assorted marriage. Forgotten&mdash;all forgotten, in
      this later time of pain and fear. Prostrate under the dread of death, her
      innermost nature&mdash;stripped of the concealments of her later life&mdash;was
      revealed to view. The early religious training, at which she had scoffed
      in the insolence of health and strength, revealed its latent influence&mdash;intermitted,
      but a living influence always from first to last. Mrs. Rook was tenderly
      mindful of her exemplary parents, and proud of exhibiting religion, on the
      bed from which she was never to rise again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I tell you that I am a miserable sinner?" she asked, after an
      interval of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily could endure it no longer. "Say that to the clergyman," she answered&mdash;"not
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but I must say it," Mrs. Rook insisted. "I <i>am</i> a miserable
      sinner. Let me give you an instance of it," she continued, with a
      shameless relish of the memory of her own frailties. "I have been a
      drinker, in my time. Anything was welcome, when the fit was on me, as long
      as it got into my head. Like other persons in liquor, I sometimes talked
      of things that had better have been kept secret. We bore that in mind&mdash;my
      old man and I&mdash;-when we were engaged by Sir Jervis. Miss Redwood
      wanted to put us in the next bedroom to hers&mdash;a risk not to be run. I
      might have talked of the murder at the inn; and she might have heard me.
      Please to remark a curious thing. Whatever else I might let out, when I
      was in my cups, not a word about the pocketbook ever dropped from me. You
      will ask how I know it. My dear, I should have heard of it from my
      husband, if I had let <i>that</i> out&mdash;and he is as much in the dark
      as you are. Wonderful are the workings of the human mind, as the poet
      says; and drink drowns care, as the proverb says. But can drink deliver a
      person from fear by day, and fear by night? I believe, if I had dropped a
      word about the pocketbook, it would have sobered me in an instant. Have
      you any remark to make on this curious circumstance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Emily had allowed the woman to ramble on, in the hope of getting
      information which direct inquiry might fail to produce. It was impossible,
      however, to pass over the allusion to the pocketbook. After giving her
      time to recover from the exhaustion which her heavy breathing sufficiently
      revealed, Emily put the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who did the pocketbook belong to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a little," said Mrs. Rook. "Everything in its right place, is my
      motto. I mustn't begin with the pocketbook. Why did I begin with it? Do
      you think this veil on my face confuses me? Suppose I take it off. But you
      must promise first&mdash;solemnly promise you won't look at my face. How
      can I tell you about the murder (the murder is part of my confession, you
      know), with this lace tickling my skin? Go away&mdash;and stand there with
      your back to me. Thank you. Now I'll take it off. Ha! the air feels
      refreshing; I know what I am about. Good heavens, I have forgotten
      something! I have forgotten <i>him</i>. And after such a fright as he gave
      me! Did you see him on the landing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you talking of?" Emily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook's failing voice sank lower still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come closer," she said, "this must be whispered. Who am I talking of?"
      she repeated. "I am talking of the man who slept in the other bed at the
      inn; the man who did the deed with his own razor. He was gone when I
      looked into the outhouse in the gray of the morning. Oh, I have done my
      duty! I have told Mr. Rook to keep an eye on him downstairs. You haven't
      an idea how obstinate and stupid my husband is. He says I couldn't know
      the man, because I didn't see him. Ha! there's such a thing as hearing,
      when you don't see. I heard&mdash;and I knew it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily turned cold from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you know again?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His voice," Mrs. Rook answered. "I'll swear to his voice before all the
      judges in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily rushed to the bed. She looked at the woman who had said those
      dreadful words, speechless with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're breaking your promise!" cried Mrs. Rook. "You false girl, you're
      breaking your promise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She snatched at the veil, and put it on again. The sight of her face,
      momentary as it had been, reassured Emily. Her wild eyes, made wilder
      still by the blurred stains of rouge below them, half washed away&mdash;her
      disheveled hair, with streaks of gray showing through the dye&mdash;presented
      a spectacle which would have been grotesque under other circumstances, but
      which now reminded Emily of Mr. Rook's last words; warning her not to
      believe what his wife said, and even declaring his conviction that her
      intellect was deranged. Emily drew back from the bed, conscious of an
      overpowering sense of self-reproach. Although it was only for a moment,
      she had allowed her faith in Mirabel to be shaken by a woman who was out
      of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try to forgive me," she said. "I didn't willfully break my promise; you
      frightened me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook began to cry. "I was a handsome woman in my time," she murmured.
      "You would say I was handsome still, if the clumsy fools about me had not
      spoiled my appearance. Oh, I do feel so weak! Where's my medicine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottle was on the table. Emily gave her the prescribed dose, and
      revived her failing strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am an extraordinary person," she resumed. "My resolution has always
      been the admiration of every one who knew me. But my mind feels&mdash;how
      shall I express it?&mdash;a little vacant. Have mercy on my poor wicked
      soul! Help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I help you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to recollect. Something happened in the summer time, when we were
      talking at Netherwoods. I mean when that impudent master at the school
      showed his suspicions of me. (Lord! how he frightened me, when he turned
      up afterward at Sir Jervis's house.) You must have seen yourself he
      suspected me. How did he show it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He showed you my locket," Emily answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the horrid reminder of the murder!" Mrs. Rook exclaimed. "<i>I</i>
      didn't mention it: don't blame Me. You poor innocent, I have something
      dreadful to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's horror of the woman forced her to speak. "Don't tell me!" she
      cried. "I know more than you suppose; I know what I was ignorant of when
      you saw the locket."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook took offense at the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clever as you are, there's one thing you don't know," she said. "You
      asked me, just now, who the pocketbook belonged to. It belonged to your
      father. What's the matter? Are you crying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was thinking of her father. The pocketbook was the last present she
      had given to him&mdash;a present on his birthday. "Is it lost?" she asked
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; it's not lost. You will hear more of it directly. Dry your eyes, and
      expect something interesting&mdash;I'm going to talk about love. Love, my
      dear, means myself. Why shouldn't it? I'm not the only nice-looking woman,
      married to an old man, who has had a lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretch! what has that got to do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything, you rude girl! My lover was like the rest of them; he would
      bet on race-horses, and he lost. He owned it to me, on the day when your
      father came to our inn. He said, 'I must find the money&mdash;or be off to
      America, and say good-by forever.' I was fool enough to be fond of him. It
      broke my heart to hear him talk in that way. I said, 'If I find the money,
      and more than the money, will you take me with you wherever you go?' Of
      course, he said Yes. I suppose you have heard of the inquest held at our
      old place by the coroner and jury? Oh, what idiots! They believed I was
      asleep on the night of the murder. I never closed my eyes&mdash;I was so
      miserable, I was so tempted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tempted? What tempted you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I had any money to spare? Your father's pocketbook tempted
      me. I had seen him open it, to pay his bill over-night. It was full of
      bank-notes. Oh, what an overpowering thing love is! Perhaps you have known
      it yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's indignation once more got the better of her prudence. "Have you no
      feeling of decency on your death-bed!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook forgot her piety; she was ready with an impudent rejoinder. "You
      hot-headed little woman, your time will come," she answered. "But you're
      right&mdash;I am wandering from the point; I am not sufficiently sensible
      of this solemn occasion. By-the-by, do you notice my language? I inherit
      correct English from my mother&mdash;a cultivated person, who married
      beneath her. My paternal grandfather was a gentleman. Did I tell you that
      there came a time, on that dreadful night, when I could stay in bed no
      longer? The pocketbook&mdash;I did nothing but think of that devilish
      pocketbook, full of bank-notes. My husband was fast asleep all the time. I
      got a chair and stood on it. I looked into the place where the two men
      were sleeping, through the glass in the top of the door. Your father was
      awake; he was walking up and down the room. What do you say? Was he
      agitated? I didn't notice. I don't know whether the other man was asleep
      or awake. I saw nothing but the pocketbook stuck under the pillow, half in
      and half out. Your father kept on walking up and down. I thought to
      myself, 'I'll wait till he gets tired, and then I'll have another look at
      the pocketbook.' Where's the wine? The doctor said I might have a glass of
      wine when I wanted it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily found the wine and gave it to her. She shuddered as she accidentally
      touched Mrs. Rook's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine helped the sinking woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must have got up more than once," she resumed. "And more than once my
      heart must have failed me. I don't clearly remember what I did, till the
      gray of the morning came. I think that must have been the last time I
      looked through the glass in the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to tremble. She tore the veil off her face. She cried out
      piteously, "Lord, be merciful to me a sinner! Come here," she said to
      Emily. "Where are you? No! I daren't tell you what I saw; I daren't tell
      you what I did. When you're pos sessed by the devil, there's nothing,
      nothing, nothing you can't do! Where did I find the courage to unlock the
      door? Where did I find the courage to go in? Any other woman would have
      lost her senses, when she found blood on her fingers after taking the
      pocketbook&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily's head swam; her heart beat furiously&mdash;she staggered to the
      door, and opened it to escape from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm guilty of robbing him; but I'm innocent of his blood!" Mrs. Rook
      called after her wildly. "The deed was done&mdash;the yard door was wide
      open, and the man was gone&mdash;when I looked in for the last time. Come
      back, come back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't go near you," she said, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come near enough to see this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her bed-gown at the throat, and drew up a loop of ribbon over
      her head. 'The pocketbook was attached to the ribbon. She held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father's book," she said. "Won't you take your father's book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, and only for a moment, Emily was repelled by the profanation
      associated with her birthday gift. Then, the loving remembrance of the
      dear hands that had so often touched that relic, drew the faithful
      daughter back to the woman whom she abhorred. Her eyes rested tenderly on
      the book. Before it had lain in that guilty bosom, it had been <i>his</i>
      book. The beloved memory was all that was left to her now; the beloved
      memory consecrated it to her hand. She took the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open it," said Mrs. Rook.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two five-pound bank-notes in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His?" Emily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; mine&mdash;the little I have been able to save toward restoring what
      I stole."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" Emily cried, "is there some good in this woman, after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no good in the woman!" Mrs. Rook answered desperately. "There's
      nothing but fear&mdash;fear of hell now; fear of the pocketbook in the
      past time. Twice I tried to destroy it&mdash;and twice it came back, to
      remind me of the duty that I owed to my miserable soul. I tried to throw
      it into the fire. It struck the bar, and fell back into the fender at my
      feet. I went out, and cast it into the well. It came back again in the
      first bucket of water that was drawn up. From that moment, I began to save
      what I could. Restitution! Atonement! I tell you the book found a tongue&mdash;and
      those were the grand words it dinned in my ears, morning and night." She
      stooped to fetch her breath&mdash;stopped, and struck her bosom. "I hid it
      here, so that no person should see it, and no person take it from me.
      Superstition? Oh, yes, superstition! Shall tell you something? <i>You</i>
      may find yourself superstitious, if you are ever cut to the heart as I
      was. He left me! The man I had disgraced myself for, deserted me on the
      day when I gave him the stolen money. He suspected it was stolen; he took
      care of his own cowardly self&mdash;and left me to the hard mercy of the
      law, if the theft was found out. What do you call that, in the way of
      punishment? Haven't I suffered? Haven't I made atonement? Be a Christian&mdash;say
      you forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do forgive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say you will pray for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that comforts me! Now you can go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked at her imploringly. "Don't send me away, knowing no more of
      the murder than I knew when I came here! Is there nothing, really nothing,
      you can tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rook pointed to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I told you already? Go downstairs, and see the wretch who escaped
      in the dawn of the morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently, ma'am, gently! You're talking too loud," cried a mocking voice
      from outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's only the doctor," said Mrs. Rook. She crossed her hands over her
      bosom with a deep-drawn sigh. "I want no doctor, now. My peace is made
      with my Maker. I'm ready for death; I'm fit for Heaven. Go away! go away!"

    <p>
      In a moment more, the doctor came in&mdash;a brisk, smiling,
      self-sufficient man&mdash;smartly dressed, with a flower in his
      button-hole. A stifling odor of musk filled the room, as he drew out his
      handkerchief with a flourish, and wiped his forehead.

      "Plenty of hard work in my line, just now," he said. "Hullo, Mrs. Rook!
      somebody has been allowing you to excite yourself. I heard you, before I
      opened the door. Have you been encouraging her to talk?" he asked, turning
      to Emily, and shaking his finger at her with an air of facetious
      remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incapable of answering him; forgetful of the ordinary restraints of social
      intercourse&mdash;with the one doubt that preserved her belief in Mirabel,
      eager for confirmation&mdash;Emily signed to this stranger to follow her
      into a corner of the room, out of hearing. She made no excuses: she took
      no notice of his look of surprise. One hope was all she could feel, one
      word was all she could say, after that second assertion of Mirabel's
      guilt. Indicating Mrs. Rook by a glance at the bed, she whispered the
      word:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Flippant and familiar, the doctor imitated her; he too looked at the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more mad than you are, miss. As I said just now, my patient has been
      exciting herself; I daresay she has talked a little wildly in consequence.
      <i>Hers</i> isn't a brain to give way, I can tell you. But there's
      somebody else&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily had fled from the room. He had destroyed her last fragment of belief
      in Mirabel's innocence. She was on the landing trying to console herself,
      when the doctor joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you acquainted with the gentleman downstairs?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What gentleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't heard his name; he looks like a clergyman. If you know him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know him. I can't answer questions! My mind&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steady your mind, miss! and take your friend home as soon as you can. <i>He</i>
      hasn't got Mrs. Rook's hard brain; he's in a state of nervous prostration,
      which may end badly. Do you know where he lives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is staying with his sister&mdash;Mrs. Delvin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Delvin! she's a friend and patient of mine. Say I'll look in
      to-morrow morning, and see what I can do for her brother. In the meantime,
      get him to bed, and to rest; and don't be afraid of giving him brandy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor returned to the bedroom. Emily heard Mrs. Ellmother's voice
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you up there, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother ascended the stairs. "It was an evil hour," she said, "that
      you insisted on going to this place. Mr. Mirabel&mdash;" The sight of
      Emily's face suspended the next words on her lips. She took the poor young
      mistress in her motherly arms. "Oh, my child! what has happened to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask me now. Give me your arm&mdash;let us go downstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be startled when you see Mr. Mirabel&mdash;will you, my dear? I
      wouldn't let them disturb you; I said nobody should speak to you but
      myself. The truth is, Mr. Mirabel has had a dreadful fright. What are you
      looking for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there a garden here? Any place where we can breathe the fresh air?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a courtyard at the back of the house. They found their way to
      it. A bench was placed against one of the walls. They sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I wait till you're better before I say any more?" Mrs. Ellmother
      asked. "No? You want to hear about Mr. Mirabel? My dear, he came into the
      parlor where I was; and Mr. Rook came in too&mdash;-and waited, looking at
      him. Mr. Mirabel sat down in a corner, in a dazed state as I thought. It
      wasn't for long. He jumped up, and clapped his hand on his heart as if his
      heart hurt him. 'I must and will know what's going on upstairs,' he says.
      Mr. Rook pulled him back, and told him to wait till the young lady came
      down. Mr. Mirabel wouldn't hear of it. 'Your wife's frightening her,' he
      says; 'your wife's telling her horrible things about me.' He was taken on
      a sudden with a shivering fit; his eyes rolled, and his teeth chattered.
      Mr. Rook made matters worse; he lost his temper. 'I'm damned,' he says,
      'if I don't begin to think you <i>are</i> the man, after all; I've half a
      mind to send for the police.' Mr. Mirabel dropped into his chair. His eyes
      stared, his mouth fell open. I took hold of his hand. Cold&mdash;cold as
      ice. What it all meant I can't say. Oh, miss, <i>you</i> know! Let me tell
      you the rest of it some other time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily insisted on hearing more. "The end!" she cried. "How did it end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how it might have ended, if the doctor hadn't come in&mdash;to
      pay his visit, you know, upstairs. He said some learned words. When he
      came to plain English, he asked if anybody had frightened the gentleman. I
      said Mr. Rook had frightened him. The doctor says to Mr. Rook, 'Mind what
      you are about. If you frighten him again, you may have his death to answer
      for.' That cowed Mr. Rook. He asked what he had better do. 'Give me some
      brandy for him first,' says the doctor; 'and then get him home at once.' I
      found the brandy, and went away to the inn to order the carriage. Your
      ears are quicker than mine, miss&mdash;do I hear it now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose, and went to the house door. The carriage was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still cowed by what the doctor had said, Mr. Rook appeared, carefully
      leading Mirabel out. He had revived under the action of the stimulant.
      Passing Emily he raised his eyes to her&mdash;trembled&mdash;and looked
      down again. When Mr. Rook opened the door of the carriage he paused, with
      one of his feet on the step. A momentary impulse inspired him with a false
      courage, and brought a flush into his ghastly face. He turned to Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I speak to you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started back from him. He looked at Mrs. Ellmother. "Tell her I am
      innocent," he said. The trembling seized on him again. Mr. Rook was
      obliged to lift him into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily caught at Mrs. Ellmother's arm. "You go with him," she said. "I
      can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you to get back, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away and spoke to the coachman. "I am not very well. I want the
      fresh air&mdash;I'll sit by you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother remonstrated and protested, in vain. As Emily had
      determined it should be, so it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he said anything?" she asked, when they had arrived at their
      journey's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been like a man frozen up; he hasn't said a word; he hasn't even
      moved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him to his sister; and tell her all that you know. Be careful to
      repeat what the doctor said. I can't face Mrs. Delvin. Be patient, my good
      old friend; I have no secrets from you. Only wait till to-morrow; and
      leave me by myself to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in her room, Emily opened her writing-case. Searching among the
      letters in it, she drew out a printed paper. It was the Handbill
      describing the man who had escaped from the inn, and offering a reward for
      the discovery of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first line of the personal description of the fugitive, the paper
      dropped from her hand. Burning tears forced their way into her eyes.
      Feeling for her handkerchief, she touched the pocketbook which she had
      received from Mrs. Rook. After a little hesitation she took it out. She
      looked at it. She opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the bank-notes repelled her; she hid them in one of the
      pockets of the book. There was a second pocket which she had not yet
      examined. She pat her hand into it, and, touching something, drew out a
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope (already open) was addressed to "James Brown, Esq., Post
      Office, Zeeland." Would it be inconsistent with her respect for her
      father's memory to examine the letter? No; a glance would decide whether
      she ought to read it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was without date or address; a startling letter to look at&mdash;for it
      only contained three words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say No."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were signed in initials:
    </p>
    <p>
      "S. J."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the instant when she read the initials, the name occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara Jethro.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIII. THE DEFENSE OF MIRABEL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The discovery of the letter gave a new direction to Emily's thoughts&mdash;and
      so, for the time at least, relieved her mind from the burden that weighed
      on it. To what question, on her father's part, had "I say No" been Miss
      Jethro's brief and stern reply? Neither letter nor envelope offered the
      slightest hint that might assist inquiry; even the postmark had been so
      carelessly impressed that it was illegible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was still pondering over the three mysterious words, when she was
      interrupted by Mrs. Ellmother's voice at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must ask you to let me come in, miss; though I know you wished to be
      left by yourself till to-morrow. Mrs. Delvin says she must positively see
      you to-night. It's my belief that she will send for the servants, and have
      herself carried in here, if you refuse to do what she asks. You needn't be
      afraid of seeing Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His sister has given up her bedroom to him," Mrs. Ellmother answered.
      "She thought of your feelings before she sent me here&mdash;and had the
      curtains closed between the sitting-room and the bedroom. I suspect my
      nasty temper misled me, when I took a dislike to Mrs. Delvin. She's a good
      creature; I'm sorry you didn't go to her as soon as we got back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did she seem to be angry, when she sent you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angry! She was crying when I left her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily hesitated no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She noticed a remarkable change in the invalid's sitting-room&mdash;so
      brilliantly lighted on other occasions&mdash;the moment she entered it.
      The lamps were shaded, and the candles were all extinguished. "My eyes
      don't bear the light so well as usual," Mrs. Delvin said. "Come and sit
      near me, Emily; I hope to quiet your mind. I should be grieved if you left
      my house with a wrong impression of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing what she knew, suffering as she must have suffered, the quiet
      kindness of her tone implied an exercise of self-restraint which appealed
      irresistibly to Emily's sympathies. "Forgive me," she said, "for having
      done you an injustice. I am ashamed to think that I shrank from seeing you
      when I returned from Belford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will endeavor to be worthy of your better opinion of me," Mrs. Delvin
      replied. "In one respect at least, I may claim to have had your best
      interests at heart&mdash;while we were still personally strangers. I tried
      to prevail on my poor brother to own the truth, when he discovered the
      terrible position in which he was placed toward you. He was too conscious
      of the absence of any proof which might induce you to believe him, if he
      attempted to defend himself&mdash;in one word, he was too timid&mdash;to
      take my advice. He has paid the penalty, and I have paid the penalty, of
      deceiving you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily started. "In what way have you deceived me?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the way that was forced on us by our own conduct," Mrs. Delvin said.
      "We have appeared to help you, without really doing so; we calculated on
      inducing you to marry my brother, and then (when he could speak with the
      authority of a husband) on prevailing on you to give up all further
      inquiries. When you insisted on seeing Mrs. Rook, Miles had the money in
      his hand to bribe her and her husband to leave England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mrs. Delvin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't attempt to excuse myself. I don't expect you to consider how
      sorely I was tempted to secure the happiness of my brother's life, by
      marriage with such a woman as yourself. I don't remind you that I knew&mdash;when
      I put obstacles in your way&mdash;that you were blindly devoting yourself
      to the discovery of an innocent man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily heard her with angry surprise. "Innocent?" she repeated. "Mrs. Rook
      recognized his voice the instant she heard him speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Impenetrable to interruption, Mrs. Delvin went on. "But what I do ask,"
      she persisted, "even after our short acquaintance, is this. Do you suspect
      me of deliberately scheming to make you the wife of a murderer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily had never viewed the serious question between them in this light.
      Warmly, generously, she answered the appeal that had been made to her.
      "Oh, don't think that of me! I know I spoke thoughtlessly and cruelly to
      you, just now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You spoke impulsively," Mrs. Delvin interposed; "that was all. My one
      desire before we part&mdash;how can I expect you to remain here, after
      what has happened?&mdash;is to tell you the truth. I have no interested
      object in view; for all hope of your marriage with my brother is now at an
      end. May I ask if you have heard that he and your father were strangers,
      when they met at the inn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there had been any conversation between them, when they retired to
      rest, they might have mentioned their names. But your father was
      preoccupied; and my brother, after a long day's walk, was so tired that he
      fell asleep as soon as his head was on the pillow. He only woke when the
      morning dawned. What he saw when he looked toward the opposite bed might
      have struck with terror the boldest man that ever lived. His first impulse
      was naturally to alarm the house. When he got on his feet, he saw his own
      razor&mdash;a blood-stained razor on the bed by the side of the corpse. At
      that discovery, he lost all control over himself. In a panic of terror, he
      snatched up his knapsack, unfastened the yard door, and fled from the
      house. Knowing him, as you and I know him, can we wonder at it? Many a man
      has been hanged for murder, on circumstantial evidence less direct than
      the evidence against poor Miles. His horror of his own recollections was
      so overpowering that he forbade me even to mention the inn at Zeeland in
      my letters, while he was abroad. 'Never tell me (he wrote) who that
      wretched murdered stranger was, if I only heard of his name, I believe it
      would haunt me to my dying day. I ought not to trouble you with these
      details&mdash;and yet, I am surely not without excuse. In the absence of
      any proof, I cannot expect you to believe as I do in my brother's
      innocence. But I may at least hope to show you that there is some reason
      for doubt. Will you give him the benefit of that doubt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly!" Emily replied. "Am I right in supposing that you don't
      despair of proving his innocence, even yet'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite despair. But my hopes have grown fainter and fainter, as
      the years have gone on. There is a person associated with his escape from
      Zeeland; a person named Jethro&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Miss Jethro!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Do you know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know her&mdash;and my father knew her. I have found a letter, addressed
      to him, which I have no doubt was written by Miss Jethro. It is barely
      possible that you may understand what it means. Pray look at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite unable to help you," Mrs. Delvin answered, after reading the
      letter. "All I know of Miss Jethro is that, but for her interposition, my
      brother might have fallen into the hands of the police. She saved him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowing him, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the remarkable part of it: they were perfect strangers to each
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she must have had some motive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>There</i> is the foundation of my hope for Miles. Miss Jethro
      declared, when I wrote and put the question to her, that the one motive by
      which she was actuated was the motive of mercy. I don't believe her. To my
      mind, it is in the last degree improbable that she would consent to
      protect a stranger from discovery, who owned to her (as my brother did)
      that he was a fugitive suspected of murder. She knows something, I am
      firmly convinced, of that dreadful event at Zeeland&mdash;and she has some
      reason for keeping it secret. Have you any influence over her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me where I can find her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you. She has removed from the address at which my brother
      saw her last. He has made every possible inquiry&mdash;without result."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she replied in those discouraging terms, the curtains which divided
      Mrs. Delvin's bedroom from her sitting-room were drawn aside. An elderly
      woman-servant approached her mistress's couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Mirabel is awake, ma'am. He is very low; I can hardly feel his pulse.
      Shall I give him some more brandy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delvin held out her hand to Emily. "Come to me to-morrow morning,"
      she said&mdash;and signed to the servant to wheel her couch into the next
      room. As the curtain closed over them, Emily heard Mirabel's voice. "Where
      am I?" he said faintly. "Is it all a dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect of his recovery the next morning was gloomy indeed. He had
      sunk into a state of deplorable weakness, in mind as well as in body. The
      little memory of events that he still preserved was regarded by him as the
      memory of a dream. He alluded to Emily, and to his meeting with her
      unexpectedly. But from that point his recollection failed him. They had
      talked of something interesting, he said&mdash;but he was unable to
      remember what it was. And they had waited together at a railway station&mdash;but
      for what purpose he could not tell. He sighed and wondered when Emily
      would marry him&mdash;and so fell asleep again, weaker than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having any confidence in the doctor at Belford, Mrs. Delvin had sent
      an urgent message to a physician at Edinburgh, famous for his skill in
      treating diseases of the nervous system. "I cannot expect him to reach
      this remote place, without some delay," she said; "I must bear my suspense
      as well as I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall not bear it alone," Emily answered. "I will wait with you till
      the doctor comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Delvin lifted her frail wasted hands to Emily's face, drew it a
      little nearer&mdash;and kissed her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIV. ON THE WAY TO LONDON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The parting words had been spoken. Emily and her companion were on their
      way to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some little time, they traveled in silence&mdash;alone in the railway
      carriage. After submitting as long as she could to lay an embargo on the
      use of her tongue, Mrs. Ellmother started the conversation by means of a
      question: "Do you think Mr. Mirabel will get over it, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's useless to ask me," Emily said. "Even the great man from Edinburgh
      is not able to decide yet, whether he will recover or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have taken me into your confidence, Miss Emily, as you promised&mdash;and
      I have got something in my mind in consequence. May I mention it without
      giving offense?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you had never taken up with Mr. Mirabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily was silent. Mrs. Ellmother, having a design of her own to
      accomplish, ventured to speak more plainly. "I often think of Mr. Alban
      Morris," she proceeded. "I always did like him, and I always shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily suddenly pulled down her veil. "Don't speak of him!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean to offend you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't offend me. You distress me. Oh, how often I have wished&mdash;!"
      She threw herself back in a corner of the carriage and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although not remarkable for the possession of delicate tact, Mrs.
      Ellmother discovered that the best course she could now follow was a
      course of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at the time when she had most implicitly trusted Mirabel, the fear
      that she might have acted hastily and harshly toward Alban had
      occasionally troubled Emily's mind. The impression produced by later
      events had not only intensified this feeling, but had presented the
      motives of that true friend under an entirely new point of view. If she
      had been left in ignorance of the manner of her father's death&mdash;as
      Alban had designed to leave her; as she would have been left, but for the
      treachery of Francine&mdash;how happily free she would have been from
      thoughts which it was now a terror to her to recall. She would have parted
      from Mirabel, when the visit to the pleasant country house had come to an
      end, remembering him as an amusing acquaintance and nothing more. He would
      have been spared, and she would have been spared, the shock that had so
      cruelly assailed them both. What had she gained by Mrs. Rook's detestable
      confession? The result had been perpetual disturbance of mind provoked by
      self-torturing speculations on the subject of the murder. If Mirabel was
      innocent, who was guilty? The false wife, without pity and without shame&mdash;or
      the brutal husband, who looked capable of any enormity? What was her
      future to be? How was it all to end? In the despair of that bitter moment&mdash;seeing
      her devoted old servant looking at her with kind compassionate eyes&mdash;Emily's
      troubled spirit sought refuge in impetuous self-betrayal; the very
      betrayal which she had resolved should not escape her, hardly a minute
      since!
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent forward out of her corner, and suddenly drew up her veil. "Do you
      expect to see Mr. Alban Morris, when we get back?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see him, miss&mdash;if you have no objection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him I am ashamed of myself! and say I ask his pardon with all my
      heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lord be praised!" Mrs. Ellmother burst out&mdash;and then, when it
      was too late, remembered the conventional restraints appropriate to the
      occasion. "Gracious, what a fool I am!" she said to herself. "Beautiful
      weather, Miss Emily, isn't it?" she continued, in a desperate hurry to
      change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily reclined again in her corner of the carriage. She smiled, for the
      first time since she had become Mrs. Delvin's guest at the tower.

      CHAPTER LXV. CECILIA IN A NEW CHARACTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reaching the cottage at night, Emily found the card of a visitor who had
      called during the day. It bore the name of "Miss Wyvil," and had a message
      written on it which strongly excited Emily's curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen the telegram which tells your servant that you return
      to-night. Expect me early to-morrow morning&mdash;with news that will
      deeply interest you."
    </p>
    <p>
      To what news did Cecilia allude? Emily questioned the woman who had been
      left in charge of the cottage, and found that she had next to nothing to
      tell. Miss Wyvil had flushed up, and had looked excited, when she read the
      telegraphic message&mdash;that was all. Emily's impatience was, as usual,
      not to be concealed. Expert Mrs. Ellmother treated the case in the right
      way&mdash;first with supper, and then with an adjournment to bed. The
      clock struck twelve, when she put out the young mistress's candle. "Ten
      hours to pass before Cecilia comes here!" Emily exclaimed. "Not ten
      minutes," Mrs. Ellmother reminded her, "if you will only go to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia arrived before the breakfast-table was cleared; as lovely, as
      gentle, as affectionate as ever&mdash;but looking unusually serious and
      subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with it at once!" Emily cried. "What have you got to tell me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, I had better tell you first," Cecilia said, "that I know what
      you kept from me when I came here, after you left us at Monksmoor. Don't
      think, my dear, that I say this by way of complaint. Mr. Alban Morris says
      you had good reasons for keeping your secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Alban Morris! Did you get your information from <i>him?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Do I surprise you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than words can tell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you bear another surprise? Mr. Morris has seen Miss Jethro, and has
      discovered that Mr. Mirabel has been wrongly suspected of a dreadful
      crime. Our amiable little clergyman is guilty of being a coward&mdash;and
      guilty of nothing else. Are you really quiet enough to read about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She produced some leaves of paper filled with writing. "There," she
      explained, "is Mr. Morris's own account of all that passed between Miss
      Jethro and himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how do <i>you</i> come by it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Morris gave it to me. He said, 'Show it to Emily as soon as possible;
      and take care to be with her while she reads it.' There is a reason for
      this&mdash;" Cecilia's voice faltered. On the brink of some explanation,
      she seemed to recoil from it. "I will tell you by-and-by what the reason
      is," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked nervously at the manuscript. "Why doesn't he tell me himself
      what he has discovered? Is he&mdash;" The leaves began to flutter in her
      trembling fingers&mdash;"is he angry with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Emily, angry with You! Read what he has written and you shall know
      why he keeps away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily opened the manuscript.

      CHAPTER LXVI. ALBAN'S NARRATIVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "The information which I have obtained from Miss Jethro has been
      communicated to me, on the condition that I shall not disclose the place
      of her residence. 'Let me pass out of notice (she said) as completely as
      if I had passed out of life; I wish to be forgotten by some, and to be
      unknown by others.'" With this one stipulation, she left me free to write
      the present narrative of what passed at the interview between us. I feel
      that the discoveries which I have made are too important to the persons
      interested to be trusted to memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. <i>She Receives Me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finding Miss Jethro's place of abode, with far less difficulty than I had
      anticipated (thanks to favoring circumstances), I stated plainly the
      object of my visit. She declined to enter into conversation with me on the
      subject of the murder at Zeeland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was prepared to meet with this rebuke, and to take the necessary
      measures for obtaining a more satisfactory reception. 'A person is
      suspected of having committed the murder,' I said; 'and there is reason to
      believe that you are in a position to say whether the suspicion is
      justified or not. Do you refuse to answer me, if I put the question?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jethro asked who the person was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mentioned the name&mdash;Mr. Miles Mirabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not necessary, and it would certainly be not agreeable to me, to
      describe the effect which this reply produced on Miss Jethro. After giving
      her time to compose herself, I entered into certain explanations, in order
      to convince her at the outset of my good faith. The result justified my
      anticipations. I was at once admitted to her confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said, 'I must not hesitate to do an act of justice to an innocent
      man. But, in such a serious matter as this, you have a right to judge for
      yourself whether the person who is now speaking to you is a person whom
      you can trust. You may believe that I tell the truth about others, if I
      begin&mdash;whatever it may cost me&mdash;by telling the truth about
      myself.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      2. <i>She Speaks of Herself</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not attempt to place on record the confession of a most unhappy
      woman. It was the common story of sin bitterly repented, and of vain
      effort to recover the lost place in social esteem. Too well known a story,
      surely, to be told again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I may with perfect propriety repeat what Miss Jethro said to me, in
      allusion to later events in her life which are connected with my own
      personal experience. She recalled to my memory a visit which she had paid
      to me at Netherwoods, and a letter addressed to her by Doctor Allday,
      which I had read at her express request.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said, 'You may remember that the letter contained some severe
      reflections on my conduct. Among other things, the doctor mentions that he
      called at the lodging I occupied during my visit to London, and found I
      had taken to flight: also that he had reason to believe I had entered Miss
      Ladd's service, under false pretenses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked if the doctor had wronged her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She answered 'No: in one case, he is ignorant; in the other, he is right.
      On leaving his house, I found myself followed in the street by the man to
      whom I owe the shame and misery of my past life. My horror of him is not
      to be described in words. The one way of escaping was offered by an empty
      cab that passed me. I reached the railway station safely, and went back to
      my home in the country. Do you blame me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was impossible to blame her&mdash;and I said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She then confessed the deception which she had practiced on Miss Ladd. 'I
      have a cousin,' she said, 'who was a Miss Jethro like me. Before her
      marriage she had been employed as a governess. She pitied me; she
      sympathized with my longing to recover the character that I had lost. With
      her permission, I made use of the testimonials which she had earned as a
      teacher&mdash;I was betrayed (to this day I don't know by whom)&mdash;and
      I was dismissed from Netherwoods. Now you know that I deceived Miss Ladd,
      you may reasonably conclude that I am likely to deceive You.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assured her, with perfect sincerity, that I had drawn no such
      conclusion. Encouraged by my reply, Miss Jethro proceeded as follows."
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <i>She Speaks of Mirabel</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Four years ago, I was living near Cowes, in the Isle of Wight&mdash;in a
      cottage which had been taken for me by a gentleman who was the owner of a
      yacht. We had just returned from a short cruise, and the vessel was under
      orders to sail for Cherbourg with the next tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'While I was walking in my garden, I was startled by the sudden
      appearance Of a man (evidently a gentleman) who was a perfect stranger to
      me. He was in a pitiable state of terror, and he implored my protection.
      In reply to my first inquiries, he mentioned the inn at Zeeland, and the
      dreadful death of a person unknown to him; whom I recognized (partly by
      the description given, and partly by comparison of dates) as Mr. James
      Brown. I shall say nothing of the shock inflicted on me: you don't want to
      know what I felt. What I did (having literally only a minute left for
      decision) was to hide the fugitive from discovery, and to exert my
      influence in his favor with the owner of the yacht. I saw nothing more of
      him. He was put on board, as soon as the police were out of sight, and was
      safely landed at Cherbourg.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked what induced her to run the risk of protecting a stranger, who
      was under suspicion of having committed a murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said, 'You shall hear my explanation directly. Let us have done with
      Mr. Mirabel first. We occasionally corresponded, during the long absence
      on the continent; never alluding, at his express request, to the horrible
      event at the inn. His last letter reached me, after he had established
      himself at Vale Regis. Writing of the society in the neighborhood, he
      informed me of his introduction to Miss Wyvil, and of the invitation that
      he had received to meet her friend and schoolfellow at Monksmoor. I knew
      that Miss Emily possessed a Handbill describing personal peculiarities in
      Mr. Mirabel, not hidden under the changed appearance of his head and face.
      If she remembered or happened to refer to that description, while she was
      living in the same house with him, there was a possibility at least of her
      suspicion being excited. The fear of this took me to you. It was a morbid
      fear, and, as events turned out, an unfounded fear: but I was unable to
      control it. Failing to produce any effect on you, I went to Vale Regis,
      and tried (vainly again) to induce Mr. Mirabel to send an excuse to
      Monksmoor. He, like you, wanted to know what my motive was. When I tell
      you that I acted solely in Miss Emily's interests, and that I knew how she
      had been deceived about her father's death, need I say why I was afraid to
      acknowledge my motive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood that Miss Jethro might well be afraid of the consequences,
      if she risked any allusion to Mr. Brown's horrible death, and if it
      afterward chanced to reach his daughter's ears. But this state of feeling
      implied an extraordinary interest in the preservation of Emily's peace of
      mind. I asked Miss Jethro how that interest had been excited?
    </p>
    <p>
      "She answered, 'I can only satisfy you in one way. I must speak of her
      father now.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily looked up from the manuscript. She felt Cecilia's arm tenderly
      caressing her. She heard Cecilia say, "My poor dear, there is one last
      trial of your courage still to come. I am afraid of what you are going to
      read, when you turn to the next page. And yet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," Emily replied gently, "it must be done. I have learned my hard
      lesson of endurance, Cecilia, don't be afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily turned to the next page.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. <i>She Speaks of the Dead</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the first time, Miss Jethro appeared to be at a loss how to proceed.
      I could see that she was suffering. She rose, and opening a drawer in her
      writing table, took a letter from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said, 'Will you read this? It was written by Miss Emily's father.
      Perhaps it may say more for me than I can say for myself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I copy the letter. It was thus expressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You have declared that our farewell to-day is our farewell forever. For
      the second time, you have refused to be my wife; and you have done this,
      to use your own words, in mercy to Me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'In mercy to Me, I implore you to reconsider your decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If you condemn me to live without you&mdash;I feel it, I know it&mdash;you
      condemn me to despair which I have not fortitude enough to endure. Look at
      the passages which I have marked for you in the New Testament. Again and
      again, I say it; your true repentance has made you worthy of the pardon of
      God. Are you not worthy of the love, admiration, and respect of man?
      Think! oh, Sara, think of what our lives might be, and let them be united
      for time and for eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I can write no more. A deadly faintness oppresses me. My mind is in a
      state unknown to me in past years. I am in such confusion that I sometimes
      think I hate you. And then I recover from my delusion, and know that man
      never loved woman as I love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You will have time to write to me by this evening's post. I shall stop
      at Zeeland to-morrow, on my way back, and ask for a letter at the post
      office. I forbid explanations and excuses. I forbid heartless allusions to
      your duty. Let me have an answer which does not keep me for a moment in
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'For the last time, I ask you: Do you consent to be my wife? Say, Yes&mdash;or
      say, No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gave her back the letter&mdash;with the one comment on it, which the
      circumstances permitted me to make:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You said No?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She bent her head in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went on&mdash;not willingly, for I would have spared her if it had been
      possible. I said, 'He died, despairing, by his own hand&mdash;and you knew
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looked up. 'No! To say that I knew it is too much. To say that I
      feared it is the truth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Did you love him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She eyed me in stern surprise. 'Have <i>I</i> any right to love? Could I
      disgrace an honorable man by allowing him to marry me? You look as if you
      held me responsible for his death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Innocently responsible,' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She still followed her own train of thought. 'Do you suppose I could for
      a moment anticipate that he would destroy himself, when I wrote my reply?
      He was a truly religious man. If he had been in his right mind, he would
      have shrunk from the idea of suicide as from the idea of a crime.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "On reflection, I was inclined to agree with her. In his terrible
      position, it was at least possible that the sight of the razor (placed
      ready, with the other appliances of the toilet, for his fellow-traveler's
      use) might have fatally tempted a man whose last hope was crushed, whose
      mind was tortured by despair. I should have been merciless indeed, if I
      had held Miss Jethro accountable thus far. But I found it hard to
      sympathize with the course which she had pursued, in permitting Mr.
      Brown's death to be attributed to murder without a word of protest. 'Why
      were you silent?' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She smiled bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A woman would have known why, without asking,' she replied. 'A woman
      would have understood that I shrank from a public confession of my
      shameful past life. A woman would have remembered what reasons I had for
      pitying the man who loved me, and for accepting any responsibility rather
      than associate his memory, before the world, with an unworthy passion for
      a degraded creature, ending in an act of suicide. Even if I had made that
      cruel sacrifice, would public opinion have believed such a person as I am&mdash;against
      the evidence of a medical man, and the verdict of a jury? No, Mr. Morris!
      I said nothing, and I was resolved to say nothing, so long as the choice
      of alternatives was left to me. On the day when Mr. Mirabel implored me to
      save him, that choice was no longer mine&mdash;and you know what I did.
      And now again when suspicion (after all the long interval that had passed)
      has followed and found that innocent man, you know what I have done. What
      more do you ask of me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Your pardon,' I said, 'for not having understood you&mdash;and a last
      favor. May I repeat what I have heard to the one person of all others who
      ought to know, and who must know, what you have told me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was needless to hint more plainly that I was speaking of Emily. Miss
      Jethro granted my request.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It shall be as you please,' she answered. 'Say for me to <i>his</i>
      daughter, that the grateful remembrance of her is my one refuge from the
      thoughts that tortured me, when we spoke together on her last night at
      school. She has made this dead heart of mine feel a reviving breath of
      life, when I think of her. Never, in our earthly pilgrimage, shall we meet
      again&mdash;I implore her to pity and forget me. Farewell, Mr. Morris;
      farewell forever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess that the tears came into my eyes. When I could see clearly
      again, I was alone in the room."

      CHAPTER LXVII. THE TRUE CONSOLATION.

    <p>
      Emily closed the pages which told her that her father had died by his own
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia still held her tenderly embraced. By slow degrees, her head
      dropped until it rested on her friend's bosom. Silently she suffered.
      Silently Cecilia bent forward, and kissed her forehead. The sounds that
      penetrated to the room were not out of harmony with the time. From a
      distant house the voices of children were just audible, singing the
      plaintive melody of a hymn; and, now and then, the breeze blew the first
      faded leaves of autumn against the window. Neither of the girls knew how
      long the minutes followed each other uneventfully, before there was a
      change. Emily raised her head, and looked at Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have one friend left," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not only me, love&mdash;oh, I hope not only me!"

    <p>
      "Yes. Only you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to say something, Emily; but I am afraid of hurting you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, do you remember what we once read in a book of history at
      school? It told of the death of a tortured man, in the old time, who was
      broken on the wheel. He lived through it long enough to say that the
      agony, after the first stroke of the club, dulled his capacity for feeling
      pain when the next blows fell. I fancy pain of the mind must follow the
      same rule. Nothing you can say will hurt me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only wanted to ask, Emily, if you were engaged&mdash;at one time&mdash;to
      marry Mr. Mirabel. Is it true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "False! He pressed me to consent to an engagement&mdash;and I said he must
      not hurry me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What made you say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought of Alban Morris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly Cecilia tried to restrain herself. A cry of joy escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you glad?" Emily asked. "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia made no direct reply. "May I tell you what you wanted to know, a
      little while since?" she said. "You asked why Mr. Morris left it all to
      me, instead of speaking to you himself. When I put the same question to
      him, he told me to read what he had written. 'Not a shadow of suspicion
      rests on Mr. Mirabel,' he said. 'Emily is free to marry him&mdash;and free
      through Me. Can <i>I</i> tell her that? For her sake, and for mine, it
      must not be. All that I can do is to leave old remembrances to plead for
      me. If they fail, I shall know that she will be happier with Mr. Mirabel
      than with me.' 'And you will submit?' I asked. 'Because I love her,' he
      answered, 'I must submit.' Oh, how pale you are! Have I distressed you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily pointed to the manuscript. "At such a time as this?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia still held to her resolution. "Such a time as this is the right
      time," she answered. "It is now, when you most want to be comforted, that
      you ought to see him. Who can quiet your poor aching heart as <i>he</i>
      can quiet it?" She impulsively snatched at the manuscript and threw it out
      of sight. "I can't bear to look at it," she said. "Emily! if I have done
      wrong, will you forgive me? I saw him this morning before I came here. I
      was afraid of what might happen&mdash;I refused to break the dreadful news
      to you, unless he was somewhere near us. Your good old servant knows where
      to go. Let me send her&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellmother herself opened the door, and stood doubtful on the
      threshold, hysterically sobbing and laughing at the same time. "I'm
      everything that's bad!" the good old creature burst out. "I've been
      listening&mdash;I've been lying&mdash;I said you wanted him. Turn me out
      of my situation, if you like. I've got him! Here he is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment, Emily was in his arms&mdash;and they were alone. On his
      faithful breast the blessed relief of tears came to her at last: she burst
      out crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Alban, can you forgive me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gently raised her head, so that he could see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love, let me look at you," he said. "I want to think again of the day
      when we parted in the garden at school. Do you remember the one conviction
      that sustained me? I told you, Emily, there was a time of fulfillment to
      come in our two lives; and I have never wholly lost the dear belief. My
      own darling, the time has come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      POSTSCRIPT. GOSSIP IN THE STUDIO.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter time had arrived. Alban was clearing his palette, after a hard
      day's work at the cottage. The servant announced that tea was ready, and
      that Miss Ladd was waiting to see him in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban ran in, and received the visitor cordially with both hands. "Welcome
      back to England! I needn't ask if the sea-voyage has done you good. You
      are looking ten years younger than when you went away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd smiled. "I shall soon be ten years older again, if I go back to
      Netherwoods," she replied. "I didn't believe it at the time; but I know
      better now. Our friend Doctor Allday was right, when he said that my
      working days were over. I must give up the school to a younger and
      stronger successor, and make the best I can in retirement of what is left
      of my life. You and Emily may expect to have me as a near neighbor. Where
      is Emily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far away in the North."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the North! You don't mean that she has gone back to Mrs. Delvin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has gone back&mdash;with Mrs. Ellmother to take care of her&mdash;at
      my express request. You know what Emily is, when there is an act of mercy
      to be done. That unhappy man has been sinking (with intervals of partial
      recovery) for months past. Mrs. Delvin sent word to us that the end was
      near, and that the one last wish her brother was able to express was the
      wish to see Emily. He had been for some hours unable to speak when my wife
      arrived. But he knew her, and smiled faintly. He was just able to lift his
      hand. She took it, and waited by him, and spoke words of consolation and
      kindness from time to time. As the night advanced, he sank into sleep,
      still holding her hand. They only knew that he had passed from sleep to
      death&mdash;passed without a movement or a sigh&mdash;when his hand turned
      cold. Emily remained for a day at the tower to comfort poor Mrs. Delvin&mdash;and
      she comes home, thank God, this evening!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I needn't ask if you are happy?" Miss Ladd said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy? I sing, when I have my bath in the morning. If that isn't
      happiness (in a man of my age) I don't know what is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how are you getting on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Famously! I have turned portrait painter, since you were sent away for
      your health. A portrait of Mr. Wyvil is to decorate the town hall in the
      place that he represents; and our dear kind-hearted Cecilia has induced a
      fascinated mayor and corporation to confide the work to my hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no hope yet of that sweet girl being married?" Miss Ladd asked.
      "We old maids all believe in marriage, Mr. Morris&mdash;though some of us
      don't own it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There seems to be a chance," Alban answered. "A young lord has turned up
      at Monksmoor; a handsome pleasant fellow, and a rising man in politics. He
      happened to be in the house a few days before Cecilia's birthday; and he
      asked my advice about the right present to give her. I said, 'Try
      something new in Tarts.' When he found I was in earnest, what do you think
      he did? Sent his steam yacht to Rouen for some of the famous pastry! You
      should have seen Cecilia, when the young lord offered his delicious gift.
      If I could paint that smile and those eyes, I should be the greatest
      artist living. I believe she will marry him. Need I say how rich they will
      be? We shall not envy them&mdash;we are rich too. Everything is
      comparative. The portrait of Mr. Wyvil will put three hundred pounds in my
      pocket. I have earned a hundred and twenty more by illustrations, since we
      have been married. And my wife's income (I like to be particular) is only
      five shillings and tenpence short of two hundred a year. Moral! we are
      rich as well as happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without a thought of the future?" Miss Ladd asked slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Doctor Allday has taken the future in hand! He revels in the
      old-fashioned jokes, which used to be addressed to newly-married people,
      in his time. 'My dear fellow,' he said the other day, 'you may possibly be
      under a joyful necessity of sending for the doctor, before we are all a
      year older. In that case, let it be understood that I am Honorary
      Physician to the family.' The warm-hearted old man talks of getting me
      another portrait to do. 'The greatest ass in the medical profession (he
      informed me) has just been made a baronet; and his admiring friends have
      decided that he is to be painted at full length, with his bandy legs
      hidden under a gown, and his great globular eyes staring at the spectator&mdash;I'll
      get you the job.' Shall I tell you what he says of Mrs. Rook's recovery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ladd held up her hands in amazement. "Recovery!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a most remarkable recovery too," Alban informed her. "It is the first
      case on record of any person getting over such an injury as she has
      received. Doctor Allday looked grave when he heard of it. 'I begin to
      believe in the devil,' he said; 'nobody else could have saved Mrs. Rook.'
      Other people don't take that view. She has been celebrated in all the
      medical newspapers&mdash;and she has been admitted to come excellent
      almshouse, to live in comfortable idleness to a green old age. The best of
      it is that she shakes her head, when her wonderful recovery is mentioned.
      'It seems such a pity,' she says; 'I was so fit for heaven.' Mr. Rook
      having got rid of his wife, is in excellent spirits. He is occupied in
      looking after an imbecile old gentleman; and, when he is asked if he likes
      the employment, he winks mysteriously and slaps his pocket. Now, Miss
      Ladd, I think it's my turn to hear some news. What have you got to tell
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I can match your account of Mrs. Rook," Miss Ladd said. "Do you
      care to hear what has become of Francine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alban, rattling on hitherto in boyish high spirits, suddenly became
      serious. "I have no doubt Miss de Sor is doing well," he said sternly.
      "She is too heartless and wicked not to prosper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are getting like your old cynical self again, Mr. Morris&mdash;and
      you are wrong. I called this morning on the agent who had the care of
      Francine, when I left England. When I mentioned her name, he showed me a
      telegram, sent to him by her father. 'There's my authority,' he said, 'for
      letting her leave my house.' The message was short enough to be easily
      remembered: 'Anything my daughter likes as long as she doesn't come back
      to us.' In those cruel terms Mr. de Sor wrote of his own child. The agent
      was just as unfeeling, in his way. He called her the victim of slighted
      love and clever proselytizing. 'In plain words,' he said, 'the priest of
      the Catholic chapel close by has converted her; and she is now a novice in
      a convent of Carmelite nuns in the West of England. Who could have
      expected it? Who knows how it may end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Miss Ladd spoke, the bell rang at the cottage gate. "Here she is!"
      Alban cried, leading the way into the hall. "Emily has come home."

1.F.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
